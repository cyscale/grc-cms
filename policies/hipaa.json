  "name": "HIPAA - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (US)",
  "slug": "hipaa",
  "body": "## Statement\n\n> **HIPAA is a federal law.** As compared to other Standards that generally offer recommendations, HIPAA is a set of controls and **requirements** companies ***MUST*** meet as covered entities.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other personal health information (PHI) and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically.\n\nIn recent years, a very important type of records that are required to be protected under HIPAA regulation is the Electronic protected health information or ePHI, defined in HIPAA as any protected health information (PHI) that is created, stored, transmitted, or received in any electronic format or media, cloud computing included. Although HIPAA has the same confidentiality requirements for all PHI, the ease with which ePHI can be copied and transmitted requires special safeguards to prevent breaches.\n\nUnder HIPAA, PHI can generally only be used to furnish medical services and process payments. There are also a few special cases when PHI must be disclosed, such as under a court-ordered warrant. Medical information that has been de-identified — stripped of all identifying information — is no longer subject to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, and can be used for other purposes, such as case studies.\n\nHIPAA is governed by three main rules:\n\n1. **Privacy Rule:** how PHI can be used and disclosed;\n1. **Security Rule:** describes standards and safeguards required to protect ePHI at rest and in transit;\n1. **Breach Notification Rule:** describes procedures and controls required to notify patients and the proper authorities in case of a PHI/ePHI data breach.\n\n## Additional information\n\n#### Scope\n\nHIPAA covers all these entities: the actual providers that offer treatment, payment, or operations in healthcare, but also all the associates with access to patient information that support them in the discharge of these services. Subcontractors, as well as business partners' associates, must comply with HIPAA.\n\n#### Purpose\n\nTechnical Safeguards play a central role in protecting HIPAA ePHI through access control. Many of these safeguards are security best practices, including:\n\n- Unique accounts for each user;\n- Strong passwords and (ideally) multi-factor authentication;\n- Providing each user the minimum ePHI access required to do their job;\n- Recording all access and changes to ePHI.\n\nAlthough Technical Safeguards are central to securing ePHI, Physical Safeguards (protecting workstations) and Administrative Safeguards (training and auditing) also play a crucial role. <Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> uses a complete HIPAA compliance checklist to protects patient confidentiality everywhere - not just in the cloud.\n\n#### Scoring Information\n\nA scoring status indicates whether compliance with the given recommendation impacts the assessed target's benchmark score. The following scoring statuses are used in this benchmark:\n\n- **Scored**\n\n    Failure to comply with \"Scored\" recommendations will decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with \"Scored\" recommendations will increase the final benchmark score.\n\n- **Not Scored**\n\n    Failure to comply with \"Not Scored\" recommendations will not decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with \"Not Scored\" recommendations will not increase the final benchmark score.\n\n### Demographics of ePHI\n\nHIPAA regulation states that ePHI includes any of 18 distinct demographics that can be used to identify a patient:\n\n1. Name\n1. Address (including subdivisions smaller than states such as a street address, city, county, or zip code)\n1. Any dates (except years) that are directly related to an individual, including birthday, date of admission or discharge, date of death, or the exact age of individuals older than 89\n1. Telephone number\n1. Fax number\n1. Email address\n1. Social Security number\n1. Medical record number\n1. Health plan beneficiary number\n1. Account number\n1. Certificate/license number\n1. Vehicle identifiers, serial numbers, or license plate numbers\n1. Device identifiers or serial numbers\n1. Web URLs\n1. IP address\n1. Biometric identifiers such as fingerprints or voiceprints\n1. Full-face photos\n1. Any other unique identifying numbers, characteristics, or codes\n\n### Penalties for HIPAA Violations\n\nPenalties for HIPAA violations can be issued by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and state attorneys general. In addition to financial penalties, covered entities are required to adopt a corrective action plan to bring policies and procedures up to the standards demanded by HIPAA.\n\n#### Violation Classifications\n\n- **Tier 1:** a violation that the covered entity was unaware of and could not have realistically avoided, had a reasonable amount of care had been taken to abide by HIPAA Rules;\n- **Tier 2:** a violation that the covered entity should have been aware of but could not have avoided even with a reasonable amount of care. (but falling short of willful neglect of HIPAA Rules);\n- **Tier 3:** a violation suffered as a direct result of \"willful neglect\" of HIPAA Rules, in cases where an attempt has been made to correct the violation;\n- **Tier 4:** a violation of HIPAA Rules constituting willful neglect, where no attempt has been made to correct the violation.\n\n#### Financial Penalties\n\n- **Tier 1:** minimum fine of $100 per violation up to $50,000;\n- **Tier 2:** minimum fine of $1,000 per violation up to $50,000;\n- **Tier 3:** minimum fine of $10,000 per violation up to $50,000;\n- **Tier 4:** minimum fine of $50,000 per violation.\n\n#### Criminal Penalties\n\n- **Tier 1:** reasonable cause or no knowledge of violation – Up to 1 year in jail;\n- **Tier 2:** obtaining PHI under pretenses – Up to 5 years in jail;\n- **Tier 3:** obtaining PHI for personal gain or with malicious intent – Up to 10 years in jail.\n\n## Security Standards - Technical Safeguards\n\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-technical-access-control\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-technical-audit\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-technical-authentication\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-technical-integrity\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-technical-transmission\"/>\n\n## Security Standards - Administrative Safeguards\n\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-administrative-management\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-administrative-security-personnel\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-administrative-access\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-administrative-training\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-administrative-evaluation\"/>\n\n## Security Standards - Physical Safeguards\n\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-physical-facility-access-control\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hipaa-physical-workstation-device-security\"/>",
