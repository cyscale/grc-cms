{"name":"Identity and Access Management","slug":"identity-access-management","body":"## Policy Statement\n\nThis policy is to provide a framework for how user accounts and privileges are created, managed, and deleted.\n\nAccess control helps \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e to implement security best practices concerning logical security, account management, and remote access.\n\nIt includes details on how new users are authorized and granted appropriate privileges, as well as how these are reviewed and revoked when necessary. It also includes appropriate controls to prevent users from obtaining unauthorized privileges or access.\n\n#### Purpose\n\nThis policy is intended to:\n\n- Protect the confidentiality and the integrity of data for which \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e is responsible. A limited number of exceptions may occur due to specific business needs. Any exception should be carefully risk assessed, approved, and signed off by the Security Director.\n\n- Mitigate against loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability due to:\n  - Misuse of privileges\n  - Introduction of viruses and malware to the network.\n\n#### Scope\n\nThis policy applies to:\n\n- All employees and suppliers who have access to \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e information and information systems.\n- Information systems and services in program, project, and operational business areas.\n- \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e boundary domain\n- Systems outside of the \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e boundary that fall under \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's responsibility as employees gain access to these systems.\n\nSome access roles require implementing stronger controls than those intended for standard users.\n\n## Objectives\n\n- Access to all computing resources, including servers, end-user computing devices, network equipment, services, and applications, must be protected by strong authentication, authorization, and auditing.\n- Interactive user access must be associated with an account or login unique to each user.\n- All credentials, including user passwords, service accounts, and access keys must meet the length, complexity, age, and rotation requirements defined in \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e security standards.\n- Use a strong password and multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible to authenticate to all computing resources (including both devices and applications).\n- MFA is required to access any critical system or resource, including but not limited to resources in \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e production environments.\n- Unused accounts, passwords, access keys must be removed within 30 days. See [Systems Audit Policy](/policies/systems-audit/show) for more info.\n- A unique access key or service account must be used for different applications or user access.\n- Authenticated sessions must time out after a defined period of inactivity.\n\n## Procedures\n\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-identity\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-sso\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-mfa\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-access\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-termination\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-least-privilege\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-endpoints-access\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-session-lock\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-vpn\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"iam-wifi\"/\u003e","version":"1","isStandard":false,"enabled":true,"procedures":[{"name":"User Identity","slug":"iam-identity","body":"Each organization selects a standard on how to define and manage user identities\n\n1. \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e selected `firstname.lastname@companyDomain.tld` as User Identity\n1. \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e can create aliases for the user identity only with prior approval and justification for a business need.
