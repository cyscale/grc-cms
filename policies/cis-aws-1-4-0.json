{"name":"CIS Amazon Web Services (AWS) Foundations Benchmark","slug":"cis-aws-1-4-0","body":"## Statement\n\nThis document provides prescriptive guidance for configuring security options for a subset of Amazon Web Services with an emphasis on foundational, testable, and architecture agnostic settings. Some of the specific Amazon Web Services in scope for this document include:\n\n- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\n- IAM Access Analyzer\n- AWS Config\n- AWS CloudTrail\n- AWS CloudWatch\n- AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)\n- AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)\n- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\n- Relational Database Service (RDS)\n- AWS VPC\n\nThere are multiple recommendations within each section. Note the use of the term recommendation as opposed to control or requirement. This reinforces the point that CIS is a self-imposed, best-practices standard, as opposed to compulsory or regulated and centralized standards such as the PCI DSS for the payment card industry or HIPAA for covered health care entities.\n\n### Intended Audience\n\nThis document is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists, auditors, help desk, platform deployment, and/or DevOps personnel who plan to develop, deploy, assess, or secure solutions in Amazon Web Services.\n\n### Scoring Information\n\nA scoring status indicates whether compliance with the given recommendation impacts the assessed target's benchmark score. The following scoring statuses are used in this benchmark:\n\n- **Scored**\n\n    Failure to comply with \"Scored\" recommendations will decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with \"Scored\" recommendations will increase the final benchmark score.\n\n- **Not Scored**\n\n    Failure to comply with \"Not Scored\" recommendations will not decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with \"Not Scored\" recommendations will not increase the final benchmark score.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"cis-aws-1-4-0-iam\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"cis-aws-1-4-0-storage\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"cis-aws-1-4-0-logging\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"cis-aws-1-4-0-monitoring\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"cis-aws-1-4-0-networking\"/\u003e","version":"1.4.0","isStandard":true,"enabled":true,"procedures":[{"name":"1.
