It also means that a breach is more than just about losing personal data.\n\nA data breach can be broadly defined as a security incident that has affected the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of personal data. In short, there will be a data breach whenever any data is lost, destroyed, corrupted, or disclosed; if someone accesses the data or passes it on without proper authorization; or if the data is made unavailable and this unavailability has a significant negative effect on individuals.\n\nIn compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA), <Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> have implemented the following policy concerning data breaches.\n\nIn the case of any data breach, <Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> must notify all affected direct parties.\n\n#### Scope\n\nThis procedure applies to all parties who access, process, or store <Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> Information or Personal Data.\n\n### 3rd Party Data Breach\n\nIf a 3rd Party data processor suffers a breach, they have a duty under contract and GDPR to inform <Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> without undue delay as soon as they become aware of the breach.\n\n<Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> 3rd Parties who are identified as personal data processors include but are not limited to: payroll providers, benefits providers, security firms.\n\n## Procedures\n\n<Procedure slug=\"breach-discovery\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"breach-containment\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"breach-assessment-risks\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"breach-notification\"/>",

Isolate the threat - identify and remove active intruders and prevent further unauthorized access;\n1. Reset passwords - force password resets for all the accounts on the domain or authentication system;\n1. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - once you've isolated the threat and reset passwords, add MFA to any accounts;\n1. Do not destroy evidence - you may need to determine where the breach started and devise a plan to prevent it from happening again. Also, depending on what type of data has been a breach, this can influence whether you need to notify the breach or not.",
