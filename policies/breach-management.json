{"name":"Breach Investigation and Notification","slug":"breach-management","body":"## Policy Statement\n\nA data breach means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data.\n\nThis includes breaches that are a result of both accidental and deliberate causes.  It also means that a breach is more than just about losing personal data.\n\nA data breach can be broadly defined as a security incident that has affected the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of personal data. In short, there will be a data breach whenever any data is lost, destroyed, corrupted, or disclosed; if someone accesses the data or passes it on without proper authorization; or if the data is made unavailable and this unavailability has a significant negative effect on individuals.\n\nIn compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA), \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e have implemented the following policy concerning data breaches.\n\nIn the case of any data breach, \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e must notify all affected direct parties.\n\n#### Scope\n\nThis procedure applies to all parties who access, process, or store \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e Information or Personal Data.\n\n### 3rd Party Data Breach\n\nIf a 3rd Party data processor suffers a breach, they have a duty under contract and GDPR to inform \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e without undue delay as soon as they become aware of the breach.\n\n\u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e 3rd Parties who are identified as personal data processors include but are not limited to: payroll providers, benefits providers, security firms.\n\n## Procedures\n\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"breach-discovery\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"breach-containment\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"breach-assessment-risks\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"breach-notification\"/\u003e","version":"1","isStandard":false,"enabled":true,"procedures":[{"name":"Breach Discovery and Investigation","slug":"breach-discovery","body":"If you become aware of, or become suspicious of, a potential data breach, you must notify \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's DPO.\n\nThere is a data breach incident reporting form attached at the end of this policy which must be completed giving as much detail as possible and submitted directly to the data protection officer.\n\n\u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e will investigate, contain, and respond to any such breaches without undue delay of receipt of the submission.

Isolate the threat - identify and remove active intruders and prevent further unauthorized access;\n1. Reset passwords - force password resets for all the accounts on the domain or authentication system;\n1. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) - once you've isolated the threat and reset passwords, add MFA to any accounts;\n1. Do not destroy evidence - you may need to determine where the breach started and devise a plan to prevent it from happening again. Also, depending on what type of data has been a breach, this can influence whether you need to notify the breach or not.","controls":[{"control":"aws-1-3-0-iam-7"},{"control":"aws-iam-2"},{"control":"aws-iam-12"},{"control":"aws-iam-13"},{"control":"aws-iam-15"},{"control":"aws-iam-17"},{"control":"gcp-iam-1"},{"control":"gcp-iam-3"},{"control":"gcp-1-1-0-iam-2"},{"control":"gcp-1-1-0-iam-6"}]},{"name":"Assessment of Risks","slug":"breach-assessment-risks","body":"To assess the risk level, \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e will maintain a confidential breach register and measure the risk against certain criteria.
