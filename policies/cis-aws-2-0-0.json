  "body": "## Statement\n\nThis document provides prescriptive guidance for configuring security options for a subset of Amazon Web Services with an emphasis on foundational, testable, and architecture agnostic settings. Some of the specific Amazon Web Services in scope for this document include:\n\n- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)\n- IAM Access Analyzer\n- AWS Config\n- AWS CloudTrail\n- AWS CloudWatch\n- AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS)\n- AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)\n- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)\n- Relational Database Service (RDS)\n- AWS VPC\n\nThere are multiple recommendations within each section. Note the use of the term recommendation as opposed to control or requirement. This reinforces the point that CIS is a self-imposed, best-practices standard, as opposed to compulsory or regulated and centralized standards such as the PCI DSS for the payment card industry or HIPAA for covered health care entities.\n\n### Intended Audience\n\nThis document is intended for system and application administrators, security specialists, auditors, help desk, platform deployment, and/or DevOps personnel who plan to develop, deploy, assess, or secure solutions in Amazon Web Services.\n\n### Scoring Information\n\nA scoring status indicates whether compliance with the given recommendation impacts the assessed target's benchmark score. The following scoring statuses are used in this benchmark:\n\n- **Scored**\n\n    Failure to comply with \"Scored\" recommendations will decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with \"Scored\" recommendations will increase the final benchmark score.\n\n- **Not Scored**\n\n    Failure to comply with \"Not Scored\" recommendations will not decrease the final benchmark score. Compliance with \"Not Scored\" recommendations will not increase the final benchmark score.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### 1. Identity and Access Management\n\nThis section contains recommendations for configuring identity and access\r management related options.\n\n<Procedure slug=\"cis-aws-2-0-0-iam\"/>\n\n### 2. Storage\n\nThis section contains recommendations for configuring AWS Storage.\n\n<Procedure slug=\"cis-aws-2-0-0-s3\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"cis-aws-2-0-0-ec2\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"cis-aws-2-0-0-rds\"/>\n\n### 3. Logging\n\nThis section contains recommendations for configuring AWS logging features.\n\n<Procedure slug=\"cis-aws-2-0-0-logging\"/>\n\n### 4. Monitoring\n\nThis section contains recommendations for configuring AWS to assist with monitoring\r\nand responding to account activities.\n\n\r\nMetric filter-related recommendations in this section are dependent on the \"Ensure\r\nCloudTrail is enabled in all regions\" and \"Ensure CloudTrail trails are\r\nintegrated with CloudWatch Logs\" recommendation in the \"Logging\" section.\n\n<Procedure slug=\"cis-aws-2-0-0-monitoring\"/>\n\n### 5. Networking\n\nThis section contains recommendations for configuring security-related aspects of AWS\r\nVirtual Private Cloud (VPC).\n\n<Procedure slug=\"cis-aws-2-0-0-networking\"/>\n",
