The categories representing Integrity and Availability will be used to guide <Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> to protect against the loss or corruption of the data.\n\n<Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> uses an asset inventory solution to ensure an updated and accurate software, cloud, physical, and data repositories asset inventory.\n\n> Asset = data/information\n\nInformation assets come in many shapes and forms. Therefore, the following list can only be illustrative. It is generally sensible to group information assets in a logical manner e.g. where they are all related to the same information system or business process.\n\n#### Scope\nAll devices, systems, people, and processes that constitute <Var keyName=\"companyName\"/> information and cloud-based systems.\n\nTip: You can generate an inventory report from the [Inventory page](https://app.cyscale.com/inventory).\n\n## Procedures\n\n<Procedure slug=\"asset-software\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"asset-cloud\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"asset-data-repositories\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"asset-physical\"/>",
