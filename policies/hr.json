{"name":"Human Resources Security","slug":"hr","body":"## Policy Statement\n\nOur Human Resources Security Policy defines the information to which the policy applies, who has proprietary rights to the information, individual accountability, responsibility for procedures, and outlines specific responsibilities within the organization. As a good practice, \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e acknowledged that rewarding positive behavior reinforces and encourages repeating it. This practice must be properly transmitted, monitored, and measured for all \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e, as defined in the scope of this policy.\n\n#### Purpose\n\nEnsure that \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's employees and contractors understand their responsibilities and are suitable for the roles for which they are considered, ensure that \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's employees and contractors are aware of and fulfill their information security responsibilities, and protect \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's other interests as part of the process of changing or terminating employment.\n\n#### Scope\n\nAll established and temporary employees who work under a contract of service, contractors, and consultants who work under a contract for service who have, or who may potentially have, access to any person or customer data contained on Cloud Systems, IT Systems, or in manual records are mandatory to comply with this policy.\n\n## Procedures\n\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"hr-management\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"hr-screening\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"hr-terms\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"hr-onboarding\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"hr-review\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"hr-disciplinary\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"hr-exiting\"/\u003e","version":"1","isStandard":false,"enabled":true,"procedures":[{"name":"HR Management","slug":"hr-management","body":"\u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e is using a HRIS for managing employees' records, payroll, expense reporting, and other activities.","controls":null},{"name":"Screening","slug":"hr-screening","body":"A good control covers background verification and competence checks on all candidates for employment. These must be carried out in accordance with the relevant laws, regulations, and ethics, and should be proportional to the business requirements, the classification of the information that will be accessed, and the perceived risks associated. For example, staff accessing higher-level information assets that carry more risk may be subject to much more stringent checks than staff who only ever get access to public information or handle assets with a limited threat.\n\nThe screening should also take place for contractors (unless their parent organization meets your broader security controls e.g. has their own ISO 27001 and does their background checks.) An auditor will expect to see a screening process with clear procedures being operated consistently each time to also help avoid any preference/prejudice risks too. Ideally, this will be aligned with the overall organization hiring process.","controls":null},{"name":"Terms and Conditions of Employment","slug":"hr-terms","body":"The contractual agreement with employees and contractors must state their and the organization's responsibilities for information security. This is also very important as regards GDPR and the new Data Protection Act 2018. They should reference and cover a whole range of control areas including overall compliance with the ISMS as well as more specifically acceptable use, the return of assets, etc.\n\nThe contractual terms and conditions should reinforce this, and the leaver's process and/or contract termination process (including the return of assets) should include a reminder to individuals that they have some responsibilities to the organization even after they have left.","controls":null},{"name":"Onboarding","slug":"hr-onboarding","body":"\u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e has a formal onboarding process, which is backed by documents and checklists.
