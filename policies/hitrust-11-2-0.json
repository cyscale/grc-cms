  "body": "The CSF was designed with security and privacy professionals in mind. By taking an abstraction of what is core to and common across most dominant frameworks, the architecture was deliberately chosen to facilitate straightforward understanding and easy consumption. Each control category in the CSF includes control objectives and control specifications, leveraging the primary categories from the ISO/IEC framework, as well as the inclusion of specific categories for an information security management program and risk management practices which collectively help to ensure organizational, regulatory compliance, and system controls are properly specified and implemented. The core structure is then integrated with various authoritative sources, along with the experience and leading practices of the HITRUST Community, to create specific implementation requirements for each control. All requirements are mapped to the related framework, standard, or regulation, and noted as an authoritative source.\n\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-1-access-control\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-2-hr-security\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-3-risk-management\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-4-security-policy\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-5-organization-of-infosec\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-6-compliance\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-7-asset management\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-8-physical-and-environmental-security\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-9-communications-and-operations-man\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-10-information-systems-aquisition\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-11-information-security-incident-management\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-12-business-continuity-management\"/>\n<Procedure slug=\"hitrust-11-2-0-13-privacy-practices\"/>",
