Any reference to a configuration file should be modified according to the actual configuration\nfiles used on the specific deployment.\n\nFor example, the configuration file for the Kubernetes API server installed by the\nkubeadm tool may be found in /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml, but\nthe same file may be called /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.manifest\nwhen installed by kops or kubespray.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n#﻿## Control plane configurations\n\nThis section consists of security recommendations for the direct configuration of\nKubernetes control plane processes. These recommendations may not be directly applicable for cluster operators in environments where these components are managed\nby a 3rd party.\n\n#﻿### Control Plane Node Configuration Files\n",
