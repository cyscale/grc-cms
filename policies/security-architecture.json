This should constantly be in the company's mindset and especially in the management board to ensure maximum security is achieved in business operations, product development, and customer care.\n\nMost of \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's Security Architecture and Design model is derived from the [OWASP-maintained Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)](https://owaspsamm.org/model/).\n\n#### Scope\n\nPeople, processes, technology, and devices.\n\n#### Objectives\n\n- Security should be a topic at all forums, e.g. engineering weekly calls and throughout the organization;\n- Ensure systems and business resilience with best practices for all business, operational, and technical departments;\n- Cloud-first, cloud-native, and data-centric culture;\n- Automate security, compliance, development, deployment, and monitoring using repeatable scripts and tools;\n- Enforce and raise awareness for the \"*Never trust, always verify*\" principle.\n\n## Procedures\n\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"secure-dev-env\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"secure-prod-env\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"secure-cloud\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"secure-principles\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"server-hardening\"/\u003e\n\n",
