The service integrates with the company's [Office 365](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_365) productivity suite and features extensions that can integrate with non-Microsoft products.\n\nMicrosoft Teams Glossary\n\n1. **Teams:** find channels to belong to or create your own. Inside channels you can hold on-the-spot meetings, have conversations, and share files;\n1. **Meetings:** see everything you've got lined up for the day or week. Or, schedule a meeting. This calendar syncs with your Outlook calendar;\n1. **Calls:** in some cases, if your organization has it set up, you can call anyone from Teams, even if they're not using Teams;\n1. **Activity:** catch up on all your unread messages, @mentions, replies, and more.\n\n#### Zoom\n\nZoom is a communication and collaboration platform that offers video meetings, web conferences, and webinars. The service integrates with many other products and services to enhance productivity and collaboration within teams.\n\n#### General recommendations and best practices\n\n- Password protect your meetings to prevent situations as Zoombombing;\n- Use the lobby feature and manually allow lobby members into the meetings;\n- Internet connection: typically, you need a minimum of 10mbps upload and download for a good quality video call;\n- Location: ensure suitable setup that is similar as much as possible to an office;\n- Background filters: not mandatory, but consider the use of a static background image. You can either use a built-in image from the library of the app or set a custom one that is company-approved. This will reduce distractions for others in the video chat, block out any unwanted cameos and protect the privacy of your home (office);\n- Headsets: though not always necessary these are recommended. Others at your location cannot hear what is being said to you, and having a mic closer to your mouth means it is less likely to pick up background noise;\n- Screen sharing: â€“ it is recommended you only share the application window you need to show. If you need to share multiple\napplications it may be necessary to share your entire screen, in this case, make sure your desktop is appropriate, you may not want others to see what applications you have installed or the picture of your family on your desktop wallpaper;\n- Framing: position yourself in the center frame when in a chat and be aware of your movements it is easy to forget that the camera, unlike a person, cannot follow you if you move out of its field of view, or rotate on your chair.\n\n#### Recording Video Conferences\n\nThe recording of video conferences should only be used where there is a clear and justifiable business reason to do so, in most cases it is recommended you check with the Chief Privacy Officer before deciding to record a session. Additional points of note are:\n\n- Recorded sessions are covered by GDPR and \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e Retention Policies, as well as taking up costly storage space;\n- You must have permission from everyone attending the session for them to be recorded and you must also specify the reason why you are recording the session. Preferably in writing (email is sufficient). Anyone objecting to being recorded should be asked to leave the session;\n- Before recording, you should plan what you are going to do with the recording afterward, where will it be stored, and for how long. Recordings must be deleted as soon as they are no longer needed.","controls":null},{"name":"Monitoring","slug":"comms-monitoring","body":"The contents of \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e systems and company data are \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e property.
