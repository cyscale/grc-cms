The very first step is to determine the level of sensitivity applicable to such Data and classify it. This step is handled by the Data Owner.\n\nAccording to some regulations, such as the HIPAA Rules, covered entities _\"must securely back up retrievable exact copies of protected health information\"_ and must be able to fully _\"restore any loss of data\"_. Furthermore, additional security rules mandate that the backup should be frequent, encrypted, tested, and stored offsite.\n\nComplete backups of both \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e and \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's customers' Protected and Confidential Data is performed daily and by respecting the `3-2-1 Backup Rule`: _\"keep at least three (3) copies of your data, and store two (2) backup copies on different storage media, with one (1) of them located offsite\"_.\n\n#### Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all Information Systems and Information Resources owned or operated by or on behalf of \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e.

Special authorization is required for use and collection, and the disclosure of this class of data is prohibited without prior approval.\n\n_Characteristics of Protected Data_\n\n- Protected Data cannot be stored outside properly protected and labeled environments.\n- Protected Data must be encrypted at all times, both at rest and in transit.\n- CISO Approval: when a business need arises, the CISO must authorize all storing, processing, and transmitting of Protected Data.\n- Compliance Risk: Protection of information is mandated by law (HIPAA, GDPR, GLBA, CCPA) or required by private contract (PCI DSS).\n- Reputation Risk: Loss of confidentiality or integrity will cause significant damage to \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's reputation.\n- Other Risks: Loss of the confidentiality or integrity of the information that could cause harm to individuals and cause the company to incur significant costs in response.\n\n_Examples of Protected Data_\n\n- PII, such as Social Security Numbers (SSN) or last four numbers of an individual's SSN\n- Personal Data for an EU Citizen - governed under GDPR\n- PHI (Protected health information) or ePHI - governed under HIPAA/HITECH\n- CHD (Payment card cardholder data) - governed under PCI-DSS/PA-DSS\n- Credit/debit card numbers, bank account, financial information\n- Production Secrets, Passwords, and Encryption keys\n\n#### **Confidential Data**\n\nThis type of data is restricted information that is required to be maintained in a highly confidential manner as directed by \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's Privacy Officer, applicable law or regulation, contractual obligation, or subject to any applicable legal privilege or protection.\n\nUnauthorized disclosure of Confidential data will cause business operations problems and some financial loss.\n\n_Characteristics of Protected Data_\n\n- Access to Confidential Data is limited to \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e employees and 3rd Parties operating under an executed non-disclosure agreement. This information should never be stored on a computing device or electronic storage media that is personally owned unless expressly permitted.\n- Protected Data must be encrypted at all times, both at rest and in transit.\n- Compliance Risk: Protection of data is mandated by law (e.g. FERPA) or required by private contract (e.g. non-disclosure agreements).\n- Reputation Risk: Loss of confidentiality or integrity will cause significant damage to \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e's reputation.
