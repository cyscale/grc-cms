  "body": "## Policy Statement\n\n\u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e has implemented an incident response process to proactively detect, report, respond to, and notify in case of incidents.\n\nAn event is any observable occurrence in a system or network. Events include a user connecting to a file share, a server receiving a request for a web page, a user sending email, and a firewall blocking a connection attempt. Adverse events are events with a negative consequence, such as system crashes, packet floods, unauthorized use of system privileges, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and the execution of malware that destroys data.\n\nA **computer security incident** is an event that violates or creates an imminent threat of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard security practices.\n\n#### Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this policy is to:\n\n-   Establish an Incident Response Team;\n-   Establish guidelines for the identification, response, reporting, assessment, analysis, and follow-up\n-   Minimize loss and destruction;\n-   Mitigate the weaknesses that were exploited;\n-   Restore functionality and business continuity as soon as possible.\n\n### Incident Response Team (IRT)\n\nPossible structures for an incident response team:\n\n1. Central Incident Response Team - single team handles all IR for \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e;\n1. Distributed Incident Response Teams - multiple teams, each responsible for a particular logical or physical segment of the organization;\n1. Employees - incident response is handled internally with limited technical and administrative support from contractors;\n1. Partially Outsourced - \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e may outsource portions of the incident response work;\n1. Fully Outsourced - \u003cVar keyName=\"companyName\"/\u003e completely outsources the incident response work.\n\n#### Current IRT\n\n| Name                    | Function           | Email                | Phone Number    | Alternate         |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |\n| **Firstname Lastname**  | COO and Co-Founder | firstname@email.com  |                 | Firstname Lastname|\n| **Firstname Lastname**  | CTO                | firstname@email.com  |                 | Firstname Lastname|\n\nThis team is charged with performing an investigation upon receiving a security alert. The team is also responsible for creating procedures for responding, analyzing, and sending notifications in case of information security incidents.\n\n## Procedures\n\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-preparation\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-detection\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-containment\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-data-gathering\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-eradication\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-recovery\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-review\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-documentation\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-notification\"/\u003e\n\u003cProcedure slug=\"ir-preventing\"/\u003e\n\n",

In such cases, it is important to document how all evidence, including compromised systems, has been preserved. Evidence should be collected according to procedures that meet all applicable laws and regulations that have been developed from previous discussions with legal staff and appropriate law enforcement agencies so that any evidence can be admissible in court. Also, evidence should be accounted for at all times; whenever evidence is transferred from person to person, chain of custody forms should detail the transfer and include each party's signature. A detailed log should be kept for all evidence, including the following:\n\n-   Identifying information (e.g., the location, serial number, model number, hostname, media access control (MAC) addresses, and IP addresses of a computer);\n-   Name, title, and phone number of each individual who collected or handled the evidence during the investigation;\n-   Time and date (including time zone) of each occurrence of evidence handling;\n-   Locations where the evidence was stored.",

For some incidents, eradication is either not necessary or is performed during recovery.\n\nEradication may involve such actions as:\n\n- Conduct a detailed vulnerability assessment;\n- Determine symptoms and cause related to the affected system(s);\n- Strengthen the defenses surrounding the affected system(s);\n- Update the Incident ticket with Eradication details.",

The compiled Incident Report constructed by the IRM will serve as a guide for this meeting.\n\nAs a whole, the group will review the presented information and will determine any weakness in the process, as well as all the appropriate actions moving forward to modify the plan, address any vulnerabilities, and establish which communication is required in case of various stakeholders.\n\n#### Process Improvement Plan\n\nThe IRM will draft a Process Improvement Plan (PIP) based on the results of this meeting. The plan should discuss any applicable items necessary to prevent future incidents to the extent practicable, including cost and time frame requirements where possible. The PIP will also include a review strategy to ensure all recommendations made in the PIP are met in a timely fashion and are functioning appropriately. Areas of focus may include, but are not limited to:\n\n- New hardware or software required\n- Patch or upgrade plans\n- Training plans (technical, end-users, etc.)\n- Policy or procedural change recommendations\n- Recommendations for changes to the Incident Response Plan\n- Regional communications recommendations\n\n#### Lessons Learned\n\nLessons learned activities should produce a set of objective and subjective data regarding each incident. Over time, the collected incident data should be useful in several capacities. The data, particularly the total hours of involvement and the cost, may be used to justify additional funding of the incident response team. A study of incident characteristics may indicate systemic security weaknesses and threats, as well as changes in incident trends. This data can be put back into the risk assessment process, ultimately leading to the selection and implementation of additional controls.\n\n#### IR Tabletop\n\nTabletop is an IR exercise that simulates (almost real-world) security incident events to develop a high-level understanding of current cybersecurity processes, and how information, alerts, and communication traverses the environment. This exercise becomes a critical success factor in the development and maintenance of a comprehensive, integrated, and security-focused incident response plan.\n\nThe tabletop session should cover:\n\n- Understand the role of Security and their interaction with other parts of the organization\n- Understand the importance of emergency response procedures from all groups within an organization (IT, Legal, HR, Marketing)\n- Provide insight into response capabilities to a Ransomware or other \"real world\" situation\n- Discuss overall effectiveness of internal/external communications",

      "slug": "ir-documentation",
      "body": "Maintain all documentation surrounding every security incident, including all work papers, notes, meeting minutes, and other items relevant to a possible investigation.\n\nOrganizations should establish a policy for how long evidence from an incident should be retained. Most organizations choose to retain all evidence for months or years after the incident ends. The following factors should be considered during the policy creation:\n\n- **Prosecution:** if the attacker may be prosecuted, evidence may need to be retained until all legal actions have been completed. In some cases, this may take several years. Furthermore, evidence that seems insignificant now may become more important in the future. For example, if an attacker can use the knowledge gathered in one attack to perform a more severe attack later, evidence from the first attack may be key to explaining how the second attack was accomplished.\n\n- **Data Retention:** most organizations have data retention policies that state how long certain types of data may be kept. For example, an organization may state that email messages should be retained for only 180 days. If a disk image contains thousands of emails, the organization may not want the image to be kept for more than 180 days unless it is necessary.\n\n- **Cost:** original hardware (e.g., hard drives, compromised systems) that is stored as evidence, as well as hard drives and removable media that are used to hold disk images, are generally individually inexpensive. However, if an organization stores many such components for years, the cost can be substantial. The organization must also retain functional computers that can use the stored hardware and media.",

      "body": "Overview of some of the main recommended practices for securing networks, systems, and applications.\n\n#### Risk Assessments\n\nPeriodic risk assessments of systems and applications should determine what risks are posed by combinations of threats and vulnerabilities. This should include understanding the applicable threats, including organization-specific threats. Each risk should be prioritized, and the risks can be mitigated, transferred, or accepted until a reasonable overall level of risk is reached. Another benefit of conducting risk assessments regularly is that critical resources are identified, allowing staff to emphasize monitoring and response activities for those resources.\n\n#### Host Security\n\nAll hosts should be hardened appropriately using standard configurations. In addition to keeping each host properly patched, hosts should be configured to follow the principle of least privilegeâ€”granting users only the privileges necessary for performing their authorized tasks. Hosts should have auditing enabled and should log significant security-related events. The security of hosts\nand their configurations should be continuously monitored. Many organizations use Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) expressed operating system and application configuration checklists to assist in securing hosts consistently and effectively.\n\n#### Network Security\n\nThe network perimeter should be configured to deny all activity that is not expressly permitted. This includes securing all connection points, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and dedicated connections to other organizations.\n\n#### Malware Prevention\n\nSoftware to detect and stop malware should be deployed throughout the organization. Malware protection should be deployed at the host level (e.g., server and workstation operating systems), the application server level (e.g., email server, web proxies), and the application client level (e.g., email clients, instant messaging clients).\n\n#### User Awareness and Training\n\nUsers should be made aware of policies and procedures regarding the appropriate use of networks, systems, and applications. Applicable lessons learned from previous incidents should also be shared with users so they can see how their actions could affect the organization. Improving user awareness regarding incidents should reduce the frequency of incidents. IT staff should be trained so that they can maintain their networks, systems, and applications per the organization's security standards.\n\n\u003e More information on awareness and training can be found in the [Security Training and Awareness Policy](/policies/security-training-awareness/show)\n\n#### Cyber Security Incident\n\nA Cyber Security Incident is any event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information resources we support or utilize internally, especially sensitive information whose theft or loss may be harmful to employees, customers, partners, or the organization as a business.\n\n#### Incident Response Team (IRT)\n\nThe IRT is made up of experts across different fields in the organization whose charge is to navigate the organization through a Cyber Security Incident from the initial investigation to mitigation, to post-incident review. Members include an Incident Response Manager, technical hardware and networking experts, front-end software experts, communications experts, and legal experts.\n\n#### Incident Response Manager (IRM)\n\nThe IRM oversees all aspects of the Cyber Security Incident, especially the IRT. The key focuses of the IRM will be to ensure proper implementation of the procedures outlined in the Cyber Security Incident Response Plan, to keep appropriate Incident Logs throughout the incident, and to act as the key liaison between IRT experts and the organization's management team. After a Cyber Security Incident, the IRM will conduct a review of the incident and produce both an Incident Summary Report and a Process Improvement Plan.\n\n#### Cyber Security Incident Log\n\nThe Cyber Security Incident Log will capture critical information about a Cyber Security Incident and the organization's response to that incident and should be maintained while the incident is in progress.\n\n#### Incident Summary Report (ISR)\n\nThe ISR is a document prepared by the IRM after a Cyber Security Incident and will provide a detailed summary of the incident, including how and why it may have occurred, estimated data loss, affected parties, and impacted services. Finally, it will examine the procedures of the Cyber Security Incident Response Plan, including how the IRT followed the procedures and whether updates are required.\n\n#### Process Improvement Plan (PIP)\n\nThe PIP is a document prepared by the IRM after a Cyber Security Incident and will provide recommendations for avoiding or minimizing the impact of future Cyber Security Incidents based upon the \"lessons learned\" from the recently-completed incident. This plan should be kept confidential for security purposes.\n\n#### Incident Severity Levels\n\n-   **Critical:** causing business interruptions and may result in a **Protected** or **Confidential** data breach;\n-   **Major:** causing business interruptions but may not result in a data breach;\n-   **Minor:** all other incidents that are not posing any business interruptions.\n\n#### Incident Classification (as per ENISA)\n\n-   Abusive Content â€“ harmful speech, spam, harassment, child porn, sexual or violent content;\n-   Malicious Code â€“ malware, rootkit, virus, worm, trojan, spyware;\n-   Information Gathering â€“ scanning, sniffing, social engineering;\n-   Intrusion Attempts â€“ exploiting known vulnerabilities, login attempts, 0-days, new attack signature;\n-   Intrusions â€“ privileged account compromise, unprivileged account compromise, application compromise, bot;\n-   Availability â€“ DoS, DDoS, sabotage, outage (no malice)\n-   Information Content Security â€“ unauthorized access to information, unauthorized modification of information;\n-   Fraud - unauthorized use of resources, copyright, masquerade, phishing;\n-   Other - all incidents which do not fit in one of the given categories should be put into this class.",
