  "body": "This integration setting enables Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly 'Microsoft Cloud App Security' or 'MCAS') to communicate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud offers an additional layer of protection by using Azure Resource Manager events, which is considered to be the control plane for Azure.

To benefit from these analytics, subscriptions must have a Cloud App Security license.\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps works only with Standard Tier subscriptions.\n\n*ï»¿*Impact**\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps works with Standard pricing tier Subscription.
