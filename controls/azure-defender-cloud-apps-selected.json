  "body": "This integration setting enables Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (formerly 'Microsoft Cloud App Security' or 'MCAS' - see additional info) to communicate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\n### Rationale\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud offers an additional layer of protection by using Azure Resource Manager events. By analyzing the Azure Resource Manager records, Microsoft Defender for Cloud detects unusual or potentially harmful operations in the Azure subscription environment.\nSeveral of the preceding analytics are powered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. The subscription must have a Cloud App Security license to benefit from these analytics. \n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps works only with Standard Tier subscriptions.\n\n### Impact\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud Apps works with a Standard subscription tier. Choosing the Standard pricing tier incurs an additional cost per resource.\n\n### Default Value\n\nWith a Cloud App Security license, these alerts are enabled by default.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nNOTE: \"Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps\" (\"MDCA\") was formerly known as \"Microsoft Cloud App Security\" (\"MCAS\"). The \"MCAS\" acronym is still used within Azure in several places (e.g., Azure CLI).",
