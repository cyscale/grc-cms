{"name":"Ensure \"Block Project-wide SSH keys\" is enabled for VM instances","slug":"gcp-vm-2","body":"It is recommended to user Instance specific SSH key(s) instead of using common/shared project-wide SSH key(s) to access Instances.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nProject-wide SSH keys are stored in Compute/Project-meta-data. Project wide SSH keys can be used to login into all the instances within project. Using project-wide SSH keys eases the SSH key management but if compromised, poses the security risk which can impact all the instances within project. It is recommended to use Instance specific SSH keys which can limit the attack surface if the SSH keys are compromised.","description":"","severity":2,"remediationDescription":"**Using Console**\n\n1. Go to the VM instances page using https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances?. It will list all the instances from project\n2. Click on the name of the Impacted instance\n3.

For Project users using gcloud or GCP Console based SSH option, no manual key creation and distribution is required and will be handled by GCE (Google compute Engine) itself. To access Instance using third party SSH clients Instance specific SSH key pairs needs to be created and distributed to the required users.\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy Default `Block Project-wide SSH keys` is not enabled. \n\n**References**\n\n1. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys","rules":[{"cloudProviders":["gcp"],"comparator":"eq","expectedResult":"[]","subjects":["VM"],"query":"gcp-vm-2-block-project-wide-ssh-keys-is-enabled-for-vm-instances","returnPath":""}]}
