  "body": "It is recommended to set the `local_infile` database flag for a Cloud SQL MySQL instance to `off`.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe `local_infile` flag controls the server-side LOCAL capability for LOAD DATA statements. Depending on the `local_infile` setting, the server refuses or permits local data loading by clients that have LOCAL enabled on the client side.\n\nTo explicitly cause the server to refuse LOAD DATA LOCAL statements (regardless of how client programs and libraries are configured at build time or runtime), start mysqld with `local_infile` disabled. `local_infile` can also be set at runtime.\n\nDue to security issues associated with the `local_infile` flag, it is recommended to disable it. This recommendation is applicable to MySQL database instances.\n\n**Impact**\n\nDisabling `local_infile` makes the server refuse local data loading by clients that have LOCAL enabled on the client side.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to the `Cloud SQL Instances` page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances\n2. Select the MySQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled\n3. Click `EDIT`\n4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section\n5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `ADD A DATABASE FLAG`, choose the flag `local_infile` from the drop-down menu, and set its value to `off`\n6. Click `SAVE`\n7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the `Overview` page\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\n1. List all Cloud SQL database instances using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances list\n```\n\n2. Configure the `local_infile` database flag for every Cloud SQL Mysql database instance using the below command:\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances patch <instanceName> --database-flags local_infile=off\n```\n\nNote: This command will overwrite all database flags that were previously set. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value. For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign (\"=\").\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can set up an Organization Policy to enforce that any new bucket has uniform bucket level access enabled. Learn more at: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/setting-org-policies#uniform-bucket\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default `local_infile` is `on`.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Check the list of supported flags https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted.\n\nNote: Some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines.\n\nNote: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.",
