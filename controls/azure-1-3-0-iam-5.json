{"name":"Ensure that 'Number of methods required to reset' is set to '2'","slug":"azure-1-3-0-iam-5","body":"Ensure that two alternate forms of identification are provided before allowing a password reset.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nLike multi-factor authentication, setting up dual identification before allowing a password reset ensures that the user identity is confirmed via two separate forms of identification. With dual identification set, an attacker would require compromising both the identity forms before he/she could maliciously reset a user's password.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"**From Azure Console**\n\n1.
