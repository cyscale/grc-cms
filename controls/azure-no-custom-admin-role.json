  "body": "The principle of least privilege should be followed, and only necessary privileges should be assigned instead of allowing full administrative access.\n\n### Rationale\n\nClassic subscription admin roles offer basic access management and include Account Administrator, Service Administrator, and Co-Administrators. It is recommended the least necessary permissions be given initially. Permissions can be added as needed by the account holder. This ensures the account holder cannot perform actions that were not intended.\n\n### Impact\n\nSubscriptions will need to be handled by Administrators with permission.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, no custom owner roles are created.",

Select `Yes`.\n\n### From Azure CLI\n\nList custom roles:\n\n```bash\naz role definition list --custom-role-only True\n```\nCheck for entries with `assignableScope` of / or the `subscription` and action of `*`. To remove a violating role:\n\n```bash\naz role definition delete --name <role_name>\n```\n\n**Note** that any role assignments must be removed before a custom role can be deleted. Ensure impact is assessed before deleting a custom role granting subscription administrator privileges.",
