After direct SSH access from the Internet is disabled, you have other options you can use to access these virtual machines for remote management:\n\n- Point-to-site VPN\n- Site-to-site VPN\n- ExpressRoute\n\nDefault Value\n\nBy default, SSH access from internet is not `enabled`.\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

  "body": "Disable SSH access on network security groups from the Internet.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe potential security problem with using SSH over the Internet is that attackers can use various brute force techniques to gain access to Azure Virtual Machines. Once the attackers gain access, they can use a virtual machine as a launch point for compromising other machines on the Azure Virtual Network or even attack networked devices outside of Azure.\n",
