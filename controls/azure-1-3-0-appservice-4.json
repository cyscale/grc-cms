Only clients that have a valid certificate will be able to reach the app.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe TLS mutual authentication technique in enterprise environments ensures the authenticity of clients to the server. If incoming client certificates are enabled, then only an authenticated client who has valid certificates can access the app.\n\n**Impact**\n\nUtilizing and maintaining client certificates will require additional work to obtain and managed replacement and key rotation.","description":"","severity":2,"remediationDescription":"**From Azure Console**\n\n1.
