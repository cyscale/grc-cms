  "remediationDescription": "### AWS\nCheck if your Lambda functions actually need to be public (i.e. anyone can invoke them). Lambda provides two authentication/authorization layers. First, is the authentication type of the function (`AuthType`). It can either require IAM authorization (`AWS_IAM`) or not (`NONE`). Then, there is the resource-based policy. Both must allow the request.\n\n#### References\n\n1. [Security and auth model for Lambda function URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/urls-auth.html)\n2﻿.
