{"name":"Ensure 'Additional email addresses' is configured with a security contact email","slug":"azure-1-3-0-sc-13","body":"Security Center emails the subscription owners whenever a high-severity alert is triggered for their subscription. You should provide a security contact email address as an additional email address.\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nAzure Security Center emails the Subscription Owner to notify them about security alerts. Adding your Security Contact's email address to the 'Additional email addresses' field ensures that your organization's Security Team is included in these alerts. This ensures that the proper people are aware of any potential compromise in order to mitigate the risk in a timely fashion.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"**From Azure Console**\n\n1.
