  "body": "The Endpoint protection component enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (formerly 'Advanced Threat Protection' or 'ATP' or 'WDATP' - see additional info) to communicate with Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** When enabling integration between DfE and DfC, some undesirable side effects may occur.\n\n1. For Server 2019 and above, if Defender is installed (the default for these server SKUs), this will trigger the deployment of the new unified agent and link to any of the extended configurations in the Defender portal.\n1. If the new unified agent is required for server SKUs of Win 2016 or Linux and lower, additional integration needs to be switched on, and agents need to be aligned.\n\n### Rationale\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Endpoint integration brings comprehensive Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) capabilities within Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This integration helps spot abnormalities and detect and respond to advanced attacks on endpoints monitored by Microsoft Defender for Cloud.\n\nMDE works only with Standard Tier subscriptions.\n\n### Impact\n\nEndpoint protection requires licensing and is included in these plans:\n\n- Defender for Servers plan 1\n- Defender for Servers plan 2\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, Endpoint protection is `off`.\n\n### Additional information\n\n\"Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)\" was formerly known as \"Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (WDATP).\" The \"WDATP\" acronym is still used within Azure in several places (e.g., Azure CLI).",
