  "body": "It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for VPC network route changes.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nGoogle Cloud Platform (GCP) routes define the paths network traffic takes from a VM instance to another destinations. The other destination can be inside your VPC network (such as another VM) or outside of it. Every route consists of a destination and a next hop. Traffic whose destination IP is within the destination range is sent to the next hop for delivery.\n\nMonitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path.\n\n*ï»¿*Impact**\n\nEnabling of logging may result in your project being charged for the additional logs usage. These charges could be significant depending on the size of the organization.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n### Create the Log Metric\n\n1. Go to `Logging`, `Log-based Metrics` by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics\n2. Select `Create metric`\n3. For `Metric Type`, select `Counter`\n4. Under `Details`, add a name and set the `Units` to `1`\n5. Under `Filter selection`, add the following query:\n\n```bash\nresource.type=\"gce_route\"\nAND (protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.routes.delete\"\nOR protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.routes.insert\")\n```\n\n6. Click `Create Metric`\n\n### Create the alert policy\n\n1. Go back to `Log-based Metrics` and identify the newly created metric under `User-defined metrics`\n2. Click the 3-dot icon in rightmost column of that metric to open menu options and select `Create alert from Metric`\n3. Fill in the required details. Choose the alerting threshold and configuration that makes sense for the organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value ensures that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project:\n\n```bash\nSet `Aggregator` to `Count`\nSet `Configuration`:\n- Condition: above\n- Threshold: 0\n- For: most recent value\n```\n4. Under `Configure notifications`, configure the desired notification channels\n5. Name the policy and select `CREATE POLICY`\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\nCreate prescribed Log Metric\n\n- Use command: gcloud beta logging metrics create\n- Reference for Command Usage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/logging/metrics/create \n\nCreate prescribed Alert Policy\n- Use command: gcloud alpha monitoring policies create\n- Reference for command Usage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/monitoring/policies/create\n\n**References**\n\n1.
