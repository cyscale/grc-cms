{"name":"Ensure that RDP access is restricted from the internet","slug":"azure-1-3-0-networking-1","body":"Disable RDP access on network security groups from the Internet.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe potential security problem with using RDP over the Internet is that attackers can use various brute force techniques to gain access to Azure Virtual Machines. Once the attackers gain access, they can use a virtual machine as a launch point for compromising other machines on an Azure Virtual Network or even attack networked devices outside of Azure.","description":"","severity":3,"remediationDescription":"Disable direct RDP access to your Azure Virtual Machines from the Internet. After direct RDP access from the Internet is disabled, you have other options you can use to access these virtual machines for remote management:\n- Point-to-site VPN\n- Site-to-site VPN\n- ExpressRoute\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, RDP access from internet is not enabled.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
