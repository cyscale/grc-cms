{"name":"Ensure IAM Users receive permissions only through Groups","slug":"aws-1-3-0-iam-15","body":"IAM users are granted access to services, functions, and data through IAM policies. There are multiple ways to define policies for an user, such as:\n  - Add the user to an IAM group that has an attached policy.\n  - Attach an inline policy directly to an user.\n  - Attach a managed policy directly to an user.\n\nOnly the first implementation is recommended.\n\nAssigning IAM policy only through groups simplifies permissions management to a single, flexible layer consistent with organizational functional roles. By simplifying permissions management, the likelihood of excessive permissions is reduced.","description":"","severity":2,"remediationDescription":"**From Console**\n\nPerform the following to create an IAM group and assign a list of policies to it:\n\n1.
