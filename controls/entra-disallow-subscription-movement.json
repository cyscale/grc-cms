  "body": "Users who are set as subscription owners can make administrative changes to the subscriptions and move them into and out of Microsoft Entra ID.\n\n### Rationale\n\nPermission to move subscriptions in and out of Microsoft Entra ID must only be given to appropriate administrative personnel. A subscription moved into a Microsoft Entra ID may be within a folder to which other users have elevated permissions. This prevents loss of data or unapproved changes of the objects within by potential bad actors.\n\n### Impact\n\nSubscriptions will need to have these settings turned off to be moved.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Subscription leaving Microsoft Entra ID directory` and `Subscription entering Microsoft Entra ID directory` are set to `Allow everyone (default)`",
