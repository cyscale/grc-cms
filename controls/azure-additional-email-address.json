You should provide a security contact email address as an additional email address.\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nMicrosoft Defender for Cloud emails the Subscription Owner to notify them about security alerts. Adding your Security Contact's email address to the 'Additional email addresses' field ensures that your organization's Security Team is included in these alerts. This ensures that the appropriate professionals are aware of any potential compromise in order to mitigate the risk in a timely manner.",
