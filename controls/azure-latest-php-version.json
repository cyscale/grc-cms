Using a supported version of PHP for app services is recommended to avoid potential unpatched vulnerabilities.\n\n### Rationale\n\nDeprecated and unsupported versions of programming and scripting languages can present vulnerabilities which may not be addressed or may not be addressable.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf your app is written using version-dependent features or libraries, they may not be available on more recent versions. If you wish to update, research the impact thoroughly.\n\n### Default Value\n\nThe version of PHP is whatever was selected upon App creation.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nCurrently supported versions can be confirmed here: [https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)",
