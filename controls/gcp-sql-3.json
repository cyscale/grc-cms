PostgreSQL does not offer any setting for No Password from cloud console.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAt the time of MySql Instance creation, not providing a administrative password allows anyone to connect to the SQL database instance with administrative privileges. Root password should be set to ensure only authorized users have these privileges.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"**Using Google Cloud Console**\n\n1.
