  "body": "The Azure Storage blobs contain data like ePHI, Financial, which can be secret or personal. Data that is erroneously modified or deleted accidentally by an application or other storage account user can cause data loss or data unavailability.\n\nIt is recommended that both Azure Containers with attached Blob Storage and standalone containers with Blob Storage be made recoverable by enabling the soft delete configuration. This is to save and recover data when blobs or blob snapshots are deleted.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nContainers and Blob Storage data can be incorrectly deleted. An attacker/malicious user may do this deliberately in order to cause disruption. Deleting an Azure Storage blob causes immediate data loss. Enabling this configuration for Azure storage ensures that even if blobs/data were deleted from the storage account, the objects are recoverable for a particular time, which is the retention period, ranging from 7 to 365 days.\n\n**Impact** \n\nAdditional storage costs may be incurred as snapshots are retained.\n",
  "severity": 2,
  "remediationDescription": "**From Azure Portal**\n\n1. Go to Storage Accounts\n2. For each Storage Account, navigate to the `Data Protection` blade, under `Data Management`\n3. Select `Enable soft delete for blobs` and `Enable soft delete for containers`\n4. Enter the number of days you want to retain soft deleted data (between 7 and 365).\n\n**Using Azure Command-Line Interface**\n\nFor blobs:\n\n```bash\naz storage blob service-properties delete-policy update --days-retained <days> --account-name <storageAccountName> --enable true\n```\n\nFor containers:\n\n```bash\naz storage account blob-service-properties update --enable-container-delete-retention true --container-delete-retention-days <days> --account-name <storageAccountName> --resource-group <resourceGroup> --account-key <accountKey>\n ```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nWhen a new storage account is created, soft delete for containers and blob storage is by default disabled.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
