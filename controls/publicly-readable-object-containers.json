When configured to allow public access, anyone can read the data (objects) without having to perform any authentication or authorization. This can lead to data leaks and can potentially generate considerable costs.\n\nE﻿ven when you want to configure the object container (bucket) for static website hosting, we recommend adding a CDN in front of it.\n\n-﻿ https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudfront-serve-static-website/\n-﻿ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/static-website-content-delivery-network\n-﻿ https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/hosting-static-website\n-﻿ https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/object-storage-service/latest/use-cdn-to-accelerate-access-to-oss\n",
