ACM is the preferred service.\n\n\r\n\r\n**Google Cloud**\n\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud offers two methods to configure SSL certificates for HTTP(S) and SSL proxy load balancers. Both methods support self-managed and Google-managed SSL certificates: `Compute Engine SSL certificate resource` and `Certificate Manager`.\r\n",

Navigate to the [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\r\n2. Under `Load Balancing`, select `Load Balancers`\r\n3. Select the load balancer you want to renew the certificate for and, on the `Listeners` tab, choose `Manage listeners`\r\n4. On the `Manage listeners` page, locate the listener to be updated, choose `Edit` under `Default SSL cert` and select it from ACM or IAM.\n\n\r\n\r\n## Google Cloud\n\n\r\n\r\nGoogle-managed SSL certificates are renewed automatically, but you have to manually review any self-managed SSL certificates.\r\nTo renew a self-managed SSL certificate, upload your new certificate and update the target proxy so that its list of SSL certificates includes the new SSL certificate in the first position to make it the primary certificate. After the new certificate, include any existing SSL certificates that you want to retain. If you have only one certificate, you need to firstly configure a new SSL certificate.\n\n**References**\n\n\r\n\r\n1.
