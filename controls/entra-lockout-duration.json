  "body": "The account lockout duration value determines how long an account retains the lockout status and, therefore, how long before a user can continue to attempt to log in after passing the lockout threshold.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAccount lockout is a method of protecting against brute-force and password spray attacks. Once the lockout threshold has been exceeded, the account enters a lockout state that prevents all login attempts for a variable duration. The lockout, combined with a reasonable duration, reduces the total number of failed login attempts that a malicious actor can execute in a given period.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf the account lockout duration is too low (less than 60 seconds), malicious actors can perform more password spray and brute-force attempts over a given period.\n\nIf the account lockout duration is too high (more than 300 seconds), users may experience inconvenient delays during lockout.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, Lockout duration in seconds is set to 60.",
