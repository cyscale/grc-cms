Unless a business requires this day-to-day delegation, security group creation should be restricted to administrators only.\n\n### Impact\n\nEnabling this setting could create many requests that would need to be managed by an administrator.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Users can create security groups in Azure portals, API or PowerShell` is set to `Yes`.",
