  "body": "Database Server should accept connections only from trusted network(s)/IP(s) and restrict access from public IP addresses.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nTo minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be white-listed to connect to it. \n\nAn authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0/0 which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world. Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe Cloud SQL database instance would not be available to public IP addresses.",
  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to the `Cloud SQL Instances` page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances\n2. Open the `Overview` page of an instance by clicking the instance name\n3. Select `Connections` from the SQL navigation menu and navigate to `NETWORKING`\n4. Click the delete icon for the authorized network `0.0.0.0/0`.\n5. Click `SAVE`\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\nUpdate the authorized network list by dropping off any addresses.\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances patch <instanceName> --authorizednetworks=ipAddress1,ipAddress2...\n```\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent new SQL instances from being configured to accept incoming connections from any IP addresses, set up a Restrict Authorized Networks on Cloud SQL instances Organization Policy at: https://console.cloud.google.com/iamadmin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictAuthorizedNetworks.\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, authorized networks are not configured. Remote connection to Cloud SQL database instance is not possible unless authorized networks are configured.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
