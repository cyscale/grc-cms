Select the PostgreSQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled\n3. Click `Edit`\n4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section\n5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `Add item`, choose the flag `log_min_error_statement` from the drop-down menu, and set its value to an appropriate one\n6. Click Save\n7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the `Overview` page\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\nConfigure the `log_min_error_statement` database flag for every Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database instance using the below command:\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances patch <instanceName> --database-flags log_min_error_statement=<DEBUG5|DEBUG4|DEBUG3|DEBUG2|DEBUG1|INFO|NOTICE|WARNING|ERROR>\n```\n\nNote: This command will overwrite all database flags that were previously set. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value. For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign (\"=\").\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default `log_min_error_statement` is `ERROR`.\n\n**References**\n\n1. [https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/flags](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/flags)\n2. [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHAT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-WHAT)\n\n**Additional information**\n\nWARNING: This patch modifies database flag values, which may require the instance to be restarted. Check the list of supported flags https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted.\n\nNote: Some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines.\n\nNote: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.",
  "body": "The `log_min_error_statement` flag defines the minimum message severity level that are considered as an error statement. Messages for error statements are logged with the SQL statement. Valid values include `DEBUG5`, `DEBUG4`, `DEBUG3`, `DEBUG2`, `DEBUG1`, `INFO`, `NOTICE`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `LOG`, `FATAL`, and `PANIC`. Each severity level includes the subsequent levels mentioned above. Ensure a value of `ERROR` or stricter is set.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAuditing helps in troubleshooting operational problems and also permits forensic analysis. If `log_min_error_statement` is not set to the correct value, messages may not be classified as error messages appropriately. Considering general log messages as error messages would make is difficult to find actual errors and considering only stricter severity levels as error messages may skip actual errors. The `log_min_error_statement` flag should be set to `ERROR` or stricter. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances.\n\n**Impact**\n\nTurning on logging will increase the required storage over time. Mismanaged logs may cause your storage costs to increase. Setting custom flags via command line on certain instances will cause all omitted flags to be reset to defaults. This may cause you to lose custom flags and could result in unforeseen complications or instance restarts. Because of this, it is recommended you apply these flags changes during a period of low usage.",
