In the section `SETTINGS`, click `Encryption`. It will show the `Storage service encryption` configuration pane\n4. Check `Use your own key`, which will expand the `Encryption Key` settings\n5. Use the option `Enter key URI` or `Select from Key Vault` to set up the encryption with your own key\n\n**Using Azure CLI**\n\n```bash\naz storage account update --name <storageAccountName> --resource-group <resourceGroup> --encryption-key-source=Microsoft.Keyvault --encryption-key-vault <keyVaultURI> --encryption-key-name <keyName> --encryption-key-version <keyVersion>\n```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, for a storage account keySource is set to Microsoft.Storage, allowing encryption with vendor Managed key and not the BYOK (Use Your Own Key).\n\n**References**\n\n1.
