  "body": "Designated users will be prompted to use their multi-factor authentication (MFA) process upon login.\n\n### Rationale\n\nEnabling multi-factor authentication is a recommended setting to limit the use of Administrative accounts to authenticated personnel.\n\n### Impact\n\nThere is an increased cost, as Conditional Access policies require **Microsoft Entra ID P1**. Similarly, MFA may require additional overhead to maintain. There is also a potential scenario in which the multi-factor authentication method can be lost, and administrative users are no longer able to log in. For this scenario, there should be an emergency access account. See [Plan a Conditional Access deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/plan-conditional-access) before deploying this.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, MFA is not enabled for any administrative accounts.",
