  "body": "Encrypt Kubernetes secrets, stored in etcd, using secrets encryption feature during \r\nAmazon EKS cluster creation.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nKubernetes can store secrets that pods can access via a mounted volume. Today, \r\nKubernetes secrets are stored with Base64 encoding, but encrypting is the \r\nrecommended approach. Amazon EKS clusters version 1.13 and higher support the \r\ncapability of encrypting your Kubernetes secrets using AWS Key Management Service \r\n(KMS) Customer Managed Keys (CMK). The only requirement is to enable the \r\nencryption provider support during EKS cluster creation.\r\nUse AWS Key Management Service (KMS) keys to provide envelope encryption of \r\nKubernetes secrets stored in Amazon EKS. Implementing envelope encryption is \r\nconsidered a security best practice for applications that store sensitive data and is part \r\nof a defense in depth security strategy.\r\nApplication-layer Secrets Encryption provides an additional layer of security for sensitive \r\ndata, such as user defined Secrets and Secrets required for the operation of the cluster, \r\nsuch as service account keys, which are all stored in etcd.\r\nUsing this functionality, you can use a key, that you manage in AWS KMS, to encrypt \r\ndata at the application layer. This protects against attackers in the event that they \r\nmanage to gain access to etcd.\n\n**Default value**\n\nBy default secrets created using the Kubernetes API are stored in tmpfs and are \r\nencrypted at rest.\n\r",
