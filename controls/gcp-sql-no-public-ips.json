  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to the `Cloud SQL Instances` page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances\n2. Select the instance name to open its `Overview` page\n3. Navigate to `Connections`, and then to `NETWORKING`\n4. Deselect the `Public IP` checkbox\n4. Click `Save`\n\n**From Google Cloud CLI**\n\n1. For every instance, remove its public IP and assign a private IP instead:\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances patch <instanceName> --network=<VPCNetworkName> --noassign-ip\n```\n\n2. Confirm the changes using the following command:\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances describe <instanceName>\n```\n\n**Prevention**\n\nTo prevent new SQL instances from getting configured with public IP addresses, set up a `Restrict Public IP access on Cloud SQL instances` Organization policy at: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictPublicIp.\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, Cloud Sql instances have a public IP.\n\n**References**\n\n1. [https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-private-ip](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-private-ip)\n2. [https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip)\n3. [https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/org-policy-constraints)\n4. [https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictPublicIp](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictPublicIp)\n\n**Addititonal information**\n\nReplicas inherit their private IP status from their primary instance. You cannot configure a private IP directly on a replica.",
  "body": "It is recommended to configure Second Generation Sql instance to use private IPs instead of public IPs.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nTo lower the organization's attack surface, Cloud SQL databases should not have public IPs. Private IPs provide improved network security and lower latency for your application.\n\n**Impact**\n\nRemoving the public IP address on SQL instances may break some applications that relied on it for database connectivity."
