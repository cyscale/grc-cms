{"name":"Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for changes to Network Access Control Lists (NACL)","slug":"aws-monitoring-11","body":"Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. NACLs are used as a stateless packet filter to control ingress and egress traffic for subnets within a VPC. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for changes made to NACLs.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nMonitoring changes to NACLs will help ensure that AWS resources and services are not unintentionally exposed.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"Perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:\n\n1. Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for unauthorized API calls and the \u003ccloudtrail_log_group_name\u003e taken from audit step 1.\n\n```bash\naws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name \u003ccloudtrail_log_group_name\u003e --filter-name `\u003cnacl_changes_metric\u003e` --metric-transformations metricName=`\u003cnacl_changes_metric\u003e`,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{ ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAcl) || ($.eventName = CreateNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAcl) || ($.eventName = DeleteNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclEntry) || ($.eventName = ReplaceNetworkAclAssociation) }'\n```\n\n**Note** You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.\n\n2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify\n\n```bash\naws sns create-topic --name \u003csns_topic_name\u003e\n```\n\n**Note** you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all monitoring alarms.\n\n3. Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2\n\n```bash\naws sns subscribe --topic-arn \u003csns_topic_arn\u003e --protocol \u003cprotocol_for_sns\u003e --notification-endpoint \u003csns_subscription_endpoints\u003e\n```\n\n**Note** you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all monitoring alarms.\n\n4. Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter created in step 1 and an SNS topic created in step 2\n\n```bash\naws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name `\u003cnacl_changes_alarm\u003e` --metric-name `\u003cnacl_changes_metric\u003e` --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 -- namespace 'CISBenchmark' --alarm-actions \u003csns_topic_arn\u003e\n```\n\n**References**\n\n1.
