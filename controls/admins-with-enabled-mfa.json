  "body": "Accounts that are assigned administrative rights are targeted by attackers. Requiring multifactor authentication (MFA) on those accounts is an easy way to reduce the risk of those accounts being compromised.\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is an important tool in protecting corporate resources. MFA, also called 2-step verification (2SV), requires users to verify their identity through something they know (such as a password) plus something they have (such as a physical key or access code).",
