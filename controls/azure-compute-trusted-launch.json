  "body": "When **Secure Boot** and **vTPM** are enabled together, they provide a strong foundation for protecting your VM from boot attacks. For example, if an attacker attempts to replace the bootloader with a malicious version, Secure Boot will prevent the VM from booting. If the attacker is able to bypass Secure Boot and install a malicious bootloader, vTPM can detect the intrusion and alert you.\n\n### Rationale\n\nSecure Boot and vTPM work together to protect your VM from various boot attacks, including bootkits, rootkits, and firmware rootkits. Not enabling Trusted Launch in Azure VM can lead to increased vulnerability to rootkits and boot-level malware, reduced ability to detect and prevent unauthorized changes to the boot process, and a potential compromise of system integrity and data security.\n\n### Impact\n\nSecure Boot and vTPM are not currently supported for Azure Generation 1 VMs. \n\n**IMPORTANT:** Before enabling Secure Boot and vTPM on a Generation 2 VM that does not already have both enabled, it is highly recommended to create a restore point of the VM before remediation.",
