The cloud disk data encryption feature automatically encrypts data when it is transferred from ECS instances to disks, and decrypts data when it is read from disks.\n\n### References\n\n\r\n\r\n1. [https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/59643.htm](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/59643.htm)\n\n### Additional Information\n\n\r\n\r\nYou cannot directly convert unencrypted disks to encrypted disks. You can encrypt system disks only when you are copying the custom images. You can encrypt the data disk by manually creating an encrypted data disk and then copy the data from the unencrypted disk to the new encrypted disk.\r\n",
