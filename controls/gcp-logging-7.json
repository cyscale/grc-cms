These charges could be significant depending on the size of the organization.",

  "remediationDescription": "### From Console\n\nCreate the prescribed log metric:\n\n1. Go to `Logging/Logs-based Metrics` by visiting [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics) and click \"CREATE METRIC\".\n2. Click the down arrow symbol on the `Filter Bar` at the rightmost corner and select `Convert to Advanced Filter`.\n3. Clear any text and add:\n\n```bash\nresource.type=\"gce_firewall_rule\"\nAND (protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.patch\"\nOR protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.insert\"\nOR protoPayload.methodName:\"compute.firewalls.delete\")\n```\n\n4. Click `Submit Filter`. Display logs appear based on the filter text entered by the user.\n5. In the `Metric Editor` menu on the right, fill out the name field. Set `Units` to `1` (default) and `Type` to `Counter`. This ensures that the log metric counts the number of log entries matching the advanced logs query.\n6. Click `Create Metric`.\n\nCreate the prescribed Alert Policy:\n\n1. Identify the newly created metric under the section `User-defined Metrics` at [https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics).\n2. Click the 3-dot icon in the rightmost column for the new metric and select `Create alert from Metric`. A new page displays.\n3. Fill out the alert policy configuration and click `Save`. Choose the alerting threshold and configuration that makes sense for the user's organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value ensures that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project:\n\n```bash\nSet `Aggregator` to `Count`\nSet `Configuration`:\n- Condition: above\n- Threshold: 0\n- For: most recent value\n```\n\n4. Configure the desired notifications channels in the section `Notifications`.\n5. Name the policy and click `Save`.\n\n### From Command Line\n\nCreate the prescribed Log Metric:\n- Use the command: `gcloud logging metrics create`\n\nCreate the prescribed Alert Policy:\n- Use the command: `gcloud alpha monitoring policies create`",
