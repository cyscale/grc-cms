User profiles contain private information such as phone numbers and email addresses, which could then be sold off to other third parties without requiring further consent from the user.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis can cause additional requests to administrators that need to be fulfilled quite often.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Users can add gallery apps to My Apps` is set to `No`.",
