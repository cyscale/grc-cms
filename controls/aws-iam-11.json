{"name":"Ensure IAM password policy expires passwords within 90 days or less","slug":"aws-iam-11","body":"IAM password policies can require passwords to be rotated or expired after a given number of days. It is recommended that the password policy expire passwords after 90 days or less.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nReducing the password lifetime increases account resiliency against brute force login attempts. Additionally, requiring regular password changes help in the following scenarios:\n\n- Passwords can be stolen or compromised sometimes without your knowledge. This can happen via a system compromise, software vulnerability, or internal threat.\n- Certain corporate and government web filters or proxy servers have the ability to intercept and record traffic even if it's encrypted.\n- Many people use the same password for many systems such as work, email, and personal.\n- Compromised end user workstations might have a keystroke logger.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"Perform the following to set the password policy as prescribed: \n\n**Via AWS Console**\n\n1.
