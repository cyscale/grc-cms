  "body": "Remembering Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for devices and browsers allows users to have the option to bypass MFA for a set number of days after performing a successful sign-in using MFA. This can enhance usability by minimizing the number of times a user may need to perform two-step verification on the same device. However, if an account or device is compromised, remembering MFA for trusted devices may affect security. Hence, it is recommended that users not be allowed to bypass MFA.\n\nThere are two main issues with this setting:\n\n1. It bypasses conditional access policies.\n2. The device remains trusted even if the user logs out.\n\nYou can read more about this setting in the [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/howto-mfa-mfasettings#remember-multifactor-authentication).\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Allow users to remember multi-factor authentication on devices they trust` is disabled.\n\n### Manual Audit\n\nSince there is no API to check this, it is recommended to manually audit the setting:\n\n> You can directly access the Service Settings page at https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/UserManagement/MfaSettings.aspx\n\n1.
