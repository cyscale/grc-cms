  "body": "Require administrators or appropriately delegated users to register third-party applications.\n\n### Rationale\n\nIt is recommended that only an administrator register custom-developed applications. This ensures the application undergoes a formal security review and approval process before exposing Microsoft Entra ID data. Certain users, like developers or other high-request users, may also be delegated permissions to prevent them from waiting on an administrative user. Your organization should review your policies and decide your needs.\n\n### Impact\n\nEnforcing this setting will create additional requests for approval that will need to be addressed by an administrator. If permissions are delegated, a user may approve a malevolent third-party application, potentially giving it access to your data.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Users can register applications` is set to \"Yes\".",
