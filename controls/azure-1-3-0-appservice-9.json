Using the latest HTTP version for web apps to take advantage of security fixes, if any, and/or new functionalities of the newer version.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nNewer versions may contain security enhancements and additional functionality. Using the latest version is recommended in order to take advantage of enhancements and new capabilities. With each software installation, organizations need to determine if a given update meetstheir requirements and also verify the compatibility and support provided for any additional software against the update revision that is selected.\n\nHTTP 2.0 has additional performance improvements on the head-of-line blocking problem of old HTTP version, header compression, and prioritization of requests. HTTP 2.0 no longer supports HTTP 1.1's chunked transfer encoding mechanism, as it provides its own, more efficient, mechanisms for data streaming.","description":"","severity":2,"remediationDescription":"**From Azure Console**\n\n1.
