After direct SSH access from the Internet is disabled, you have other options you can use to access these virtual machines for remote management:\n\n- Point-to-site VPN\n- Site-to-site VPN\n- ExpressRoute\n\nBy default, SSH access from the internet is not `enabled`.\n\nFor more details check Azure specific control for this issue: `azure-1-3-0-networking-2`.\n\n#### References\n\n1.

Restrict access to only those IP addresses that require it, in order to implement the principle of least privilege and reduce the possibility of a breach.\n\n#### References\n\n1.
