  "body": "Ensure that the number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information is not set to 0.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis setting is necessary if you have setup the `Require users to register when signing in` option. If authentication re-confirmation is disabled, registered users will never be prompted to re-confirm their existing authentication information. If the authentication information for a user changes, such as a phone number or email, then the password reset information for that user reverts to the previously registered authentication information.\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers will be prompted for their multifactor authentication at the duration set here.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, the `Number of days before users are asked to re-confirm their authentication information` is set to \"180 days\".",
