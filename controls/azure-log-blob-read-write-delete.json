  "body": "The Storage Blob service provides scalable, cost-efficient object storage in the cloud. Storage Logging happens server-side and allows details for successful and failed requests to be recorded in the storage account. These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the blobs. Storage Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests: timing information such as start time, end-to-end latency, and server latency; authentication details; concurrency information; and the sizes of the request and response messages.\n\n### Rationale\n\nStorage Analytics logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor each individual request for increased security or diagnostics. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.\n\nStorage Analytics logging is not enabled by default for your storage account.\n\n### Impact\n\nEnabling this setting can significantly impact the cost of the log analytics service and data storage used by logging more data per request. Do not enable this without determining your need for this level of logging, and do not forget to check in on data usage and projected cost. Some users have seen their logging costs increase from $10 per month to $10,000 per month.\n\n### Default Value\n\nStorage Analytics logging is not enabled by default for your storage account.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nDue to their nature and intent, we cannot practically generalize detailed audit log requirements for every blob. This recommendation may be applicable to storage account blob service, where security is paramount.",
