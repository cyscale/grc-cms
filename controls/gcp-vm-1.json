  "body": "To support principle of least privileges and prevent potential privilege escalation it is recommended that instances are not assigned to default service account `Compute Engine default service account` with Scope `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAlong with ability to optionally create, manage and use user managed custom service accounts, Google Compute Engine provides default service account `Compute Engine default service account` for an instances to access necessary cloud services. `Project Editor role` is assigned to `Compute Engine default service account` hence, This service account has almost all capabilities over all cloud services except billing. However, when `Compute Engine default service account` assigned to an instance it can operate in 3 scopes.\n\n```\n1. Allow default access: Allows only minimum access required to run an Instance (Least Privileges)\n2. Allow full access to all Cloud APIs: Allow full access to all the cloud APIs/Services (Too much access)\n3. Set access for each API: Allows Instance administrator to choose only those APIs that are needed to perform specific business functionality expected by instance\n```\n\nWhen an instance is configured with `Compute Engine default service account` with Scope `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`, based on IAM roles assigned to the user(s) accessing Instance, it may allow user to perform cloud operations/API calls that user is not supposed to perform leading to successful privilege escalation.",

Go to the `VM instances` page by visiting: [https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances).\n2. Click on the impacted VM instance.\n3. If the instance is not stopped, click the `Stop` button. Wait for the instance to be stopped.\n4. Next, click the `Edit` button.\n5. Scroll down to the `Service Account` section.\n6. Select a different service account or ensure that `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs` is not selected.\n7. Click the `Save` button to save your changes and then click `START`.\n\n### From Command Line\n\n1. Stop the instance:\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances stop <INSTANCE_NAME>\n```\n\n2. Update the instance:\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances set-service-account <INSTANCE_NAME> --service- account=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT> --scopes [SCOPE1, SCOPE2...]\n```\n\n3. Restart the instance:\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances start <INSTANCE_NAME>\n```\n\n### Default Value\n\nWhile creating a VM instance, default service account is used with scope `Allow default access`.\n```\n\n**Impact**\n\nIn order to change service account or scope for an instance, it needs to be stopped.\n\n**References**\n\n1. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances\n2. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts\n\n**Notes**\n\n- User IAM roles will override service account scope but configuring minimal scope ensures defense in depth\n- Non-default service accounts do not offer selection of access scopes like default service account. IAM roles with non-default service accounts should be used to control VM access.",
