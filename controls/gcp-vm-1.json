{"name":"Ensure that instances are not configured to use the default service account with full access to all Cloud APIs","slug":"gcp-vm-1","body":"To support principle of least privileges and prevent potential privilege escalation it is recommended that instances are not assigned to default service account `Compute Engine default service account` with Scope `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAlong with ability to optionally create, manage and use user managed custom service accounts, Google Compute Engine provides default service account `Compute Engine default service account` for an instances to access necessary cloud services. `Project Editor` role is assigned to `Compute Engine default service account` hence, This service account has almost all capabilities over all cloud services except billing. However, when `Compute Engine default service account` assigned to an instance it can operate in 3 scopes.\n```\n1. Allow default access: Allows only minimum access required to run an Instance (Least Privileges)\n2. Allow full access to all Cloud APIs: Allow full access to all the cloud APIs/Services (Too much access)\n3. Set access for each API: Allows Instance administrator to choose only those APIs that are needed to perform specific business functionality expected by instance\n```\nWhen an instance is configured with `Compute Engine default service account` with Scope `Allow full access to all Cloud APIs`, based on IAM roles assigned to the user(s) accessing Instance, it may allow user to perform cloud operations/API calls that user is not supposed to perform leading to successful privilege escalation.","description":"","severity":3,"remediationDescription":"**From Console**\n\n1.

IAM roles with non-default service accounts should be used to control VM access.","rules":[{"cloudProviders":["gcp"],"comparator":"eq","expectedResult":"[]","subjects":["VM"],"query":"gcp-vm-1-instances-are-not-configured-to-use-the-default-service-account-with-full-access-to-all-cloud-apis","returnPath":""}]}
