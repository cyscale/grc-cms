  "body": "Joining or registering devices to the Microsoft Entra ID should require Multi-factor authentication.\n\n### Rationale\n\nMulti-factor authentication is recommended when adding devices to Microsoft Entra ID. When set to `Yes`, users who are adding devices from the internet must first use the second authentication method before their device is successfully added to the directory. This ensures that rogue devices are not added to the domain using a compromised user account. Note: Some Microsoft documentation suggests using conditional access policies to join a domain from certain whitelisted networks or devices. Even with these in place, using Multi-Factor Authentication is still recommended, as it creates a process for review before joining the domain.\n\n### Impact\n\nThere is a slight impact of additional overhead, as Administrators will now have to approve every access to the domain.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Require Multi-Factor Authentication to register or join devices with Microsoft Entra` is set to `No`.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nIf Conditional Access is available, this recommendation should be bypassed in favor of implementing [Conditional Access that requires Multifactor Authentication to register or join devices with Microsoft Entra](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/how-to-policy-mfa-device-register-join).",
