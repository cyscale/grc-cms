  "body": "The RBAC role `cluster-admin` provides wide-ranging powers over the environment and should be used only where and when needed.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nKubernetes provides a set of default roles where RBAC is used. Some of these roles such as `cluster-admin` provide wide-ranging privileges which should only be applied where necessary. Roles such as `cluster-admin` allow super-user access to perform any action on any resource. When used in a `ClusterRoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the cluster and in all namespaces. When used in a `RoleBinding`, it gives full control over every resource in the rolebinding's namespace, including the namespace itself.\n\n**Impact**\n\nCare should be taken before removing any `ClusterRoleBindings` from the environment to ensure they were not required for the operation of the cluster. Specifically, modifications should not be made to `ClusterRoleBindings` with the `system:` prefix as they are required for the operation of system components.",
