  "body": "Ensure that network flow logs are captured and fed into a central log analytics workspace.\n\n### Rationale\n\nNetwork Flow Logs provide valuable insight into the flow of traffic around your network and feed into Azure Monitor and Azure Sentinel (if in use), permitting the generation of visual flow diagrams to aid with analyzing for lateral movement, etc.\n\n### Impact\n\nThe impact of configuring NSG Flow logs is primarily cost and configuration. If deployed, it will create storage accounts that hold minimal amounts of data for a 5-day lifecycle before feeding it to the Log Analytics Workspace.\n\nThis will increase the amount of data stored and used by Azure Monitor.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, Network Security Group logs are not sent to Log Analytics.\n\n### References\n\n- (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal]\n- (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-logging-threat-detection#lt-4-enable-network-logging-for-security-investigation)[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-logging-threat-detection#lt-4-enable-network-logging-for-security-investigation]",
