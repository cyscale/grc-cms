  "body": "It is recommended that IAM policy on Cloud Storage bucket does not allows anonymous and/or public access.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAllowing anonymous and/or public access grants permissions to anyone to access bucket content. Such access might not be desired if you are storing any sensitive data. Hence, ensure that anonymous and/or public access to a bucket is not allowed.\n\n**Impact**\n\nNo storage buckets would be publicly accessible. You would have to explicitly administer bucket access.",

  "remediationDescription": "### From Google Cloud Console\n\n1. Go to Storage browser by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser\n2. Click on a bucket name to go to its `Bucket details` page\n3. Click on the `PERMISSIONS` tab\n4. For principals `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers`, click on the `Edit principal` pencil button to modify the permissions\n5. Click the `Delete` button on the right to remove that particular role assignment\n6. Select `SAVE`\n\n### CLI\n\nRemove `allUsers` and `allAuthenticatedUsers` access.\n\n```bash\ngsutil iam ch -d allUsers gs://<bucketName>\ngsutil iam ch -d allAuthenticatedUsers gs://<bucketName>\n```\n\n### Prevention\n\nYou can prevent Storage buckets from becoming publicly accessible by setting up the `Domain restricted sharing` organization policy at: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/iamallowedPolicyMemberDomains\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, Storage buckets are not publicly shared.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

[https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/iam](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/iam)\n\n### Addititonal information\n\nTo implement Access restrictions on buckets, configuring Bucket IAM is preferred more than configuring Bucket ACL. On GCP console, \"Edit Permissions\" for bucket exposes the IAM configurations only. Bucket ACLs are configured automatically as per need in order to implement/support User enforced Bucket IAM policy. In the case that the administrator changes a bucket ACL using command-line(gsutils)/API, the bucket IAM also gets updated automatically.",
