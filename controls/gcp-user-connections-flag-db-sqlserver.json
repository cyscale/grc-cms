  "body": "It is recommended to check the `user connections` for a Cloud SQL SQL Server instance to ensure that it is not artificially limiting connections.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe `user connections` option specifies the maximum number of simultaneous user connections that are allowed on an instance of SQL Server. The actual number of user connections allowed also depends on the version of SQL Server that you are using, as well as the limits of your application or applications and hardware. SQL Server allows a maximum of 32,767 user connections. Because user connections is by default a selfconfiguring value, SQL Server adjusts the maximum number of user connections automatically as needed, up to the maximum value allowable. For example, if only 10 users are logged in, 10 user connection objects are allocated. In most cases, you do not have to change the value for this option. The default is 0, which means that the maximum (32,767) user connections are allowed. However if there is a number defined here that limits connections, SQL Server will not allow anymore above this limit. If the connections are at the limit, any new requests will be dropped, potentially causing lost data or outages for those using the database.\n\n**Impact**\n\nSetting custom flags via command line on certain instances will cause all omitted flags to be reset to defaults. This may cause you to lose custom flags and could result in unforeseen complications or instance restarts. Because of this, it is recommended you apply these flags changes during a period of low usage.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to the `Cloud SQL Instances` page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances\n2. Select the SQL Server instance where the database flag needs to be enabled\n3. Click `EDIT`\n4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section\n5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `ADD A DATABASE FLAG`, choose the flag `user connections` from the drop-down menu, and set its value to the value recommended by your organization\n6. Click `SAVE`\n7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the `Overview` page\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\nConfigure the `user connections` database flag for every Cloud SQL SQL Server database instance using the below command.\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances patch <instanceName> --database-flags \"user connections=[0-32,767]\"\n```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, `user connections` is set to `0`, which does not limit the number of connections, giving the server free reign to facilitate a maxmum of 32,767 connections.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
