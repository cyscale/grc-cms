  "body": "Disable access from Azure services to SQL Servers.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nIf access from Azure services is enabled, the server's firewall will accept connections from all Azure resources, including resources outside of your subscription. This is usually not a desired configuration. Instead, setup firewall rules to allow access from specific network ranges or VNET rules to allow access from specific virtual networks.",
  "severity": 3,
  "remediationDescription": "**From Azure Console**\n\n1. Go to `SQL Servers`\n2. For each database, under `Security`, select `Networking`\n3. Under `Exceptions`, uncheck `Allow Azure services and resources to access this server`\n4. Select `Save`\n\n**Using Azure Command Line Interface**\n\nUse the below command to delete the `AllowAllWindowsAzureIps` rule for SQL Server.\n\n```bash\naz sql server firewall-rule delete --name AllowAllWindowsAzureIps --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --server <serverName>\n```\n\n**References**\n\n1.
