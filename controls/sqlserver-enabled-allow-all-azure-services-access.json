  "body": "Disable access from Azure services to SQL Server\n\n**Rationale**\n\nIf access from Azure services is enabled, the server's firewall will accept connections from all Azure resources, including resources not in your subscription. This is usually not a desired configuration. Instead, setup firewall rules to allow access from specific network ranges or VNET rules to allow access from specific virtual networks.",
