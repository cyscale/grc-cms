  "body": "The account lockout threshold determines how many failed login attempts are permitted before the account is locked out and initiated with a variable lockout duration.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAccount lockout is a method of protecting against brute-force and password spray attacks. Once the lockout threshold has been exceeded, the account enters a lockout state that prevents all login attempts for a variable duration. The lockout, in combination with a reasonable duration, reduces the total number of failed login attempts that a malicious actor can execute in a given period of time.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf the account lockout threshold is set too low (less than 3), users may experience frequent lockout events, and the resulting security alerts may contribute to alert fatigue.\n\nIf the account lockout threshold is set too high (more than 10), malicious actors can programmatically execute more password attempts in a given period.",
