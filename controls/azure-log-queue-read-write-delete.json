  "body": "The Storage Queue service stores messages that any client accessing the storage account may read. A queue can contain an unlimited number of messages, each of which can be up to 64KB in size using version 2011-08-18 or newer. Storage Logging happens server-side and allows details for successful and failed requests to be recorded in the storage account. These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the queues. Storage Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests: Timing information such as start time, end-to-end latency, server latency, authentication details, concurrency information, and the sizes of the request and response messages.\n\n### Rationale\n\nStorage Analytics logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and diagnose issues with the service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, storage account queue services are not logged.\n\n### Impact\n\nEnabling this setting can significantly impact the cost of the log analytics service and data storage used by logging more data per request. Do not enable this without determining your need for this level of logging, and do not forget to check in on data usage and projected cost. Some users have seen their logging costs increase from $10 per month to $10,000 per month.\n\n### Additional Information\n\nDue to their nature and intent, we cannot practically generalize detailed audit log requirements for every queue. This recommendation may apply to storage account queue services where security is paramount.",
