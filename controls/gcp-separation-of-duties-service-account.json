  "body": "It is recommended that the principle of 'Separation of Duties' is enforced while assigning service-account related roles to users.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe built-in/predefined IAM role `Service Account Admin` allows the user/identity to create, delete, and manage service account(s). The built-in/predefined IAM role `Service Account User` allows the user/identity (with adequate privileges on Compute and App Engine) to assign service account(s) to Apps/Compute Instances.\nSeparation of duties is the concept of ensuring that one individual does not have all necessary permissions to be able to complete a malicious action. In Cloud IAM - service accounts, this could be an action such as using a service account to access resources that user should not normally have access to.\nSeparation of duties is a business control typically used in larger organizations, meant to help avoid security or privacy incidents and errors. It is considered a best practice.\nNo user should have `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User` roles assigned at the same time.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe removed role should be assigned to a different user based on business needs.",
  "severity": 2,
  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Under `IAM & Admin`, go to `IAM`\n2. For any member having both `Service Account Admin` and `Service Account User` roles granted/assigned, click the `Delete` Bin icon to remove either role from the member. Removal of a role should be done based on business requirements.\n\n**References**\n\n1. [https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)\n2.
