  "body": "A container-optimized OS is an operating system image that is designed for secure managed hosting of containers on compute instances.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nUse cases for container-optimized OSes might include:\n* Docker container or Kubernetes support with minimal setup.\n* A small-secure container footprint.\n* An OS that is tested, hardened, and verified for running Kubernetes nodes in your compute instances.\n\nContainer-optimized OSes have a smaller footprint which will reduce the instance's potential attack surface. The container runtime is pre-installed and security settings like locked-down firewall are configured by default. Container-optimized images may also be configured to automatically update on a regular period in the background.\n\n**Audit**\n\nIf a container-optimized OS is required examine the nodes in EC2 and click on their AMI to ensure that it is a container-optimized OS like Amazon Bottlerocket; or connect to the worker node and check its OS.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
