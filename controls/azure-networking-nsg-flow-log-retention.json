  "body": "Network Security Group Flow Logs should be enabled and the retention period is set to greater than or equal to 90 days.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nFlow logs enable the capture of information about IP traffic flowing in and out of network security groups. Logs can be used to check for anomalies and give insight into suspected breaches.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis will keep IP traffic logs for longer than 90 days. As a level 2, determine your need to retain data and apply your selection here. As this is data stored for longer, your monthly storage costs will increase depending on your data use.\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, Network Security Group Flow Logs are disabled.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
