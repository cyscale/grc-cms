{"name":"Ensure PodSecurityPolicy controller is enabled on the Kubernetes Engine Clusters","slug":"gcp-kubernetes-14","body":"A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls security sensitive aspects of the pod specification. The PodSecurityPolicy objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system, as well as defaults for the related fields.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe PodSecurityPolicy defines a set of conditions that Pods must meet to be accepted by the cluster; when a request to create or update a Pod does not meet the conditions in the PodSecurityPolicy, that request is rejected and an error is returned. The PodSecurityPolicy admission controller validates requests against available PodSecurityPolicies. PodSecurityPolicies specify a list of restrictions, requirements, and defaults for Pods created under the policy.","description":"","severity":2,"remediationDescription":"**Using Command Line**\n\nTo enable Pod Security Policy for an existing cluster, run the following command: \n\n```bash\ngcloud beta container clusters update \\[CLUSTER_NAME\\] --zone \\[COMPUTE_ZONE\\] --enable-pod-security-policy\n```\n\n**Impact**\n\nIf you enable the PodSecurityPolicy controller without first defining and authorizing any actual policies, no users, controllers, or service accounts can create or update Pods. If you are working with an existing cluster, you should define and authorize policies before enabling the controller.\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, Pod Security Policy is disabled when you create a new cluster.\n\n**References**\n\n1. https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/pod-security-policies 2. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy\n\n**Notes**\n\nThis is a Beta release of PodSecurityPolicies in Kubernetes Engine. This feature is not covered by any SLA or deprecation policy and might be subject to backward-incompatible changes.","rules":null}
