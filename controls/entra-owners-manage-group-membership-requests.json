This ensures that security groups are appropriately managed and their management is not delegated to non-administrators.\n\n### Impact\n\nGroup Membership for user accounts will need to be handled by Admins and cause administrative overhead.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Owners can manage group membership requests in My Groups` is set to `No`.\n",
