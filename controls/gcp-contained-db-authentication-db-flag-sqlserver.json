  "body": "It is recommended to set `contained database authentication` database flag for Cloud SQL SQL Server instance to `off`.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nA contained database includes all database settings and metadata required to define the database and has no configuration dependencies on the instance of the Database Engine where the database is installed. Users can connect to the database without authenticating a login at the Database Engine level. Isolating the database from the Database Engine makes it possible to easily move the database to another instance of SQL Server. Contained databases have some unique threats that should be understood and mitigated by SQL Server Database Engine administrators. Most of the threats are related to the USER WITH PASSWORD authentication process, which moves the authentication boundary from the Database Engine level to the database level, hence this is recommended to disable this flag. This recommendation is applicable to SQL Server database instances.\n\n**Impact**\n\nWhen `contained database authentication` is off (0) for the instance, contained databases cannot be created, or attached to the Database Engine. Turning on logging will increase the required storage over time. Mismanaged logs may cause your storage costs to increase.Setting custom flags via command line on certain instances will cause all omitted flags to be reset to defaults. This may cause you to lose custom flags and could result in unforeseen complications or instance restarts. Because of this, it is recommended you apply these flags changes during a period of low usage.",
  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to the `Cloud SQL Instances` page in the Google Cloud Console by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances.\n2. Select the MySQL instance where the database flag needs to be enabled\n3. Click `EDIT`\n4. Scroll down to the `Flags` section\n5. To set a flag that has not been set on the instance before, click `ADD A DATABASE FLAG`, choose the flag `contained database authentication` from the drop-down menu, and set its value to `off`\n6. Click `SAVE`\n7. Confirm the changes under `Flags` on the `Overview` page\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\nConfigure the `contained database authentication` database flag for every Cloud SQL PosgreSQL database instance using the below command.\n\n```bash\ngcloud sql instances patch <instanceName> --database-flags \"contained database authentication=off\"\n```\n\nNote: This command will overwrite all database flags that were previously set. To keep those and add new ones, include the values for all flags to be set on the instance; any flag not specifically included is set to its default value. For flags that do not take a value, specify the flag name followed by an equals sign (\"=\").\n\n**Default Value**\n\nAs you have to manually turn on this flag, the default value for this is 'On'. Though you would have had to design your database schema from the start to include this feature, it often is not enabled.\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Check the list of supported flags https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/flags - to see if your instance will be restarted when this patch is submitted.\n\nNote: Some database flag settings can affect instance availability or stability, and remove the instance from the Cloud SQL SLA. For information about these flags, see Operational Guidelines.\n\nNote: Configuring the above flag restarts the Cloud SQL instance.",
