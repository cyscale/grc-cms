  "body": "> If your organization pays for Microsoft Entra ID licensing (included in Microsoft 365 E3, E5, or F5, and EM&S E3 or E5 licenses) and CAN use Conditional Access, ignore the recommendations in this section and proceed to the Conditional Access section.\n\nSecurity defaults is available to everyone. The goal is to ensure that all organizations have a basic level of security enabled at no extra cost. You may turn on security defaults in the Azure portal.\n\n### Rationale\n\nSecurity defaults provide secure default settings that we manage on behalf of organizations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings.\n\nFor example, doing the following:\n\n- Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.\n- Challenging users with MFA - when necessary, based on factors such as location, device, role, and task.\n- Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which canâ€™t do MFA.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis recommendation should be implemented initially and then may be overridden by other service/product-specific CIS Benchmarks. Administrators should also be aware that certain configurations in Microsoft Entra ID may impact other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft 365.\n\n### Default Value\n\nIf your tenant was created on or after October 22, 2019, security defaults may already be enabled in your tenant.\n\n### References\n\n- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/conceptfundamentals-security-defaults](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/conceptfundamentals-security-defaults)\n- [https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directoryidentity/introducing-security-defaults/ba-p/1061414](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-active-directoryidentity/introducing-security-defaults/ba-p/1061414)\n- [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-identitymanagement#im-2-protect-identity-and-authentication-systems](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-identitymanagement#im-2-protect-identity-and-authentication-systems)",
