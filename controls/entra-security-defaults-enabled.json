  "body": "Security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID make it easier to be secure and help protect your organization. Security defaults contain preconfigured security settings for common attacks.\n\nSecurity defaults is available to everyone. The goal is to ensure that all organizations have a basic level of security enabled at no extra cost. You may turn on security defaults in the Azure portal.\n\n### Rationale\n\nSecurity defaults provide secure default settings that we manage on behalf of organizations to keep customers safe until they are ready to manage their own identity security settings.\nFor example, doing the following:\n\n- Requiring all users and admins to register for MFA.\n- Challenging users with MFA - when necessary, based on factors such as location, device, role, and task.\n- Disabling authentication from legacy authentication clients, which can’t do MFA.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis recommendation should be implemented initially and then may be overridden by other service/product specific CIS Benchmarks. Administrators should also be aware that certain configurations in Microsoft Entra ID may impact other Microsoft services such as Microsoft 365.",
