{"name":"Ensure that Diagnostic Logs are enabled for all services which support it","slug":"azure-1-3-0-logging-3","body":"Diagnostic Logs capture activity to the data access plane while the Activity log is a subscription-level log for the control plane. Resource-level diagnostic logs provide insight into operations that were performed within that resource itself, for example, getting a secret from a Key Vault. Currently, 32 Azure resources support Diagnostic Logging (See the references section for a complete list), including Network Security Groups, Load Balancers, Key Vault, AD, Logic Apps and CosmosDB. The content of these logs varies by resource type. For example, Windows event system logs area category of diagnostics logs for VMs, and blob, table, and queue logs are categories of diagnostics logs for storage accounts.A number of back-end services were not configured to log and store Diagnostic Logs for certain activities or for a sufficient length. It is crucial that logging systems are correctly configured to log all relevant activities and retain those logs for a sufficient length of time. By default, Diagnostic Logs are not enabled. Given that the mean time to detection in an enterprise is240 days, a minimum retention period of two years is recommended.\n\nNote: The CIS Benchmark covers some specific Diagnostic Logs separately.\n\n\u003e`3.3 -Ensure Storage logging is enabled for Queue service for read, write, and delete requests`\n\u003e\n\u003e`6.4 Ensure that Network Security Group Flow Log retention period is 'greater than 90 days'`\n\n**Rationale**\n\nA lack of Diagnostic Logs reduces the visibility into the data plane and therefore an organization's ability to detect reconnaissance, authorization attempts or other malicious activity. Unlike Activity Logs, Diagnostic Logs are not enabled by default. Specifically, without Diagnostic Logs it would be impossible to tell which entities had accessed a data store that which was breached. In addition, alerts for failed attempts to access APIs for Web Services or Databases are only possible when Diagnostic Logging is enabled.\n\n**Impact**\n\nCosts for Log Analytics Workspaces varies with Log Volume.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"Azure Subscriptions should log every access and operation for all resources.Logs should be sent to Storage and a Log AnalyticsWorkspace or equivalent third-party system.Logs should be kept in readilyaccessible storage for a minimum of one year, and then moved to inexpensive cold storage for aduration of time as necessary. Ifretention policies are set but storing logs in a Storage Accountis disabled (for example, if only Event Hubs or Log Analyticsoptions are selected), the retention policies have no effect.Enable all logging at first, and then be moreaggressive moving data to cold storage if the volume of databecomes a cost concern.\n\n**From Azure Console**\n\nThe specific steps for configuring resources within the Azureconsole vary depending on resource, but typically the steps are:\n\n1. Go to the resource\n2. Click on `Diagnostic settings`\n3. In the blade that appears, click `\"Add diagnostic setting\"`\n4. Configure the diagnostic settings\n5. Click on `Save`\n\n**Using Azure Command Line Interface**\n\nEnable logging for all resources which support Diagnostic Logs to ensure interactions within theresource are logged and available. The skeleton command for creatinglogs and metrics with unlimited retention on ageneric resource are shown below.\n\n```bash \naz monitor diagnostic-settings create --resource {ID} -n {name}--event-hub-rule {eventHubRuleID} --storage-account {storageAccount}\n--logs '[{\"category\": \"WorkflowRuntime\",\"enabled\": true,\"retentionPolicy\": {\"enabled\": false,\"days\": 0}}]'\n--metrics '[{\"category\": \"WorkflowRuntime\",\"enabled\": true,\"retentionPolicy\": {\"enabled\": false,\"days\": 0}}]'```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nDisabled\n\n**References**\n\n1.
