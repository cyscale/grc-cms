{"name":"Ensure that multi-factor authentication is enabled for all non-privileged users","slug":"azure-1-3-0-iam-2","body":"Enable multi-factor authentication for all non-privileged users.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nMulti-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.\n\n**Impact**\n\nUsers would require two forms of authentication before any action is granted. Also, this requires an overhead for managing dual forms of authentication.\n","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"Follow Microsoft Azure documentation and setup multi-factor authentication in your environment.\n\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa)\n","rules":null}
