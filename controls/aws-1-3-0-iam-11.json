When creating the IAM user access type you have to determine what type of access they require.\n\n**Programmatic access**:The IAM user might need to make API calls, use the AWS CLI, or use the tools for windows powershell. In that case, create an access key (access key ID and a secret access key) for that user.\n**AWS Management Console access**: If the user needs to access the AWS Management Console, create a password for the user.\n\nAfter user profile is created, user can create access keys for programmatic access which will provide an indication that it is needed for their work. User can also put a support ticket to have access keys created for them.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"**From Console**\n\nPerform the following action to check if an access key is created during user creation:\n\n1.
