  "body": "Restrict invitations to users with specific administrative roles only.\n\n### Rationale\n\nRestricting invitations to users with specific administrator roles ensures that only authorized accounts can access cloud resources. This helps to maintain \"Need to Know\" permissions and prevents inadvertent access to data.\n\nBy default, `Guest invite restrictions` is set to `Anyone in the organization can invite guest users including guests and non-admins`. This would allow anyone within the organization to invite guests and non-admins to the tenant, posing a security risk.\n\n### Impact\n\nWith the option of `Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users` selected, users with specific admin roles will be responsible for sending invitations to the external users, requiring additional overhead to manage user accounts. This will mean coordinating with other departments as they are onboarding new users.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Guest invite restrictions` is set to `Anyone in the organization can invite guest users including guests and non-admins`.",
