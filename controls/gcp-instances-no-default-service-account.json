  "body": "It is recommended to configure your instance to not use the default Compute Engine service account because it has the Editor role on the project.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe default Compute Engine service account has the Editor role on the project, which allows read and write access to most Google Cloud Services. To defend against privilege escalations if your VM is compromised and prevent an attacker from gaining access to all of your project, it is recommended to not use the default Compute Engine service account. Instead, you should create a new service account and assigning only the permissions needed by your instance.\n\nThe default Compute Engine service account is named `<projectNumber>-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to the `VM instances` page by visiting: https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances\n2. Click on each VM instance name to go to its details page\n3. Click `STOP` and then click `EDIT`\n4. Under the section `Identity and API access`, select a service account other than the default Compute Engine service account. You may first need to create a new service account.\n5. Click `Save` and then click `START`\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\n1. Stop the instance:\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances stop <instanceName>\n```\n\n2. Update the instance:\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances set-service-account <instanceName> --serviceaccount=<serviceAccount>\n```\n\n3. Restart the instance:\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances start <instanceName>\n```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, Compute instances are configured to use the default Compute Engine service account.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
