  "body": "By default, App Services can be deployed over FTP. If FTP is required for an essential deployment workflow, FTPS should be required for FTP login for all App Services.\n\nIf FTPS is not expressly required for the App, the recommended setting is `Disabled.`\n\n### Rationale\n\nFTP is an unencrypted network protocol that will transmit data - including passwords - in clear-text. The use of this protocol can lead to both data and credential compromise, and can present opportunities for exfiltration, persistence, and lateral movement.\n\n### Impact\n\nAny deployment workflows that rely on FTP or FTPs rather than the WebDeploy or HTTPs endpoints may be affected.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, FTP based deployment is `All allowed`.",
