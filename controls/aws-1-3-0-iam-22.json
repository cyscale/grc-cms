  "body": "In multi-account environments, IAM user centralization facilitates greater user control. User access beyond the initial account is then provide via role assumption. Centralization of users can be accomplished through federation with an external identity provider or through the use of AWS Organizations.\n\nCentralizing IAM user management to a single identity provider, reduces complexity and thus less access management errors.",

Determine the master account for identity federation or IAM user management.\n2. Sign into the AWS console and open the [IAM Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/home).\n3.
