  "body": "VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow Logs be enabled for packet \"Rejects\" for VPCs.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nVPC Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can be used to detect anomalous traffic or insight during security workflows.",

  "remediationDescription": "Perform the following to determine if VPC Flow logs is enabled: \n\n**Via the Management Console**\n\n1. Sign into the management console\n2. Select `Services` then `VPC`\n3. In the left navigation pane, select `Your VPCs`\n4. Select a VPC\n5. In the right pane, select the `Flow Logs` tab.\n6. If no Flow Log exists, click `Create Flow Log`\n7. `For` Filter, select `Reject`\n8. Enter in a `Role` and `Destination Log Group`\n9. Click `Create Log Flow`\n10. Click on `CloudWatch Logs Group`\n\n**Note** Setting the filter to \"Reject\" will dramatically reduce the logging data accumulation for this recommendation and provide sufficient information for the purposes of breach detection, research and remediation. However, during periods of least privilege security group engineering, setting this the filter to \"All\" can be very helpful in discovering existing traffic flows required for proper operation of an already running environment.\n\n**Impact**\n\nBy default, CloudWatch Logs will store Logs indefinitely unless a specific retention period is defined for the log group. When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in mind the average days it takes an organization to realize they have been breached is 210 days (at the time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a minimum 365 day retention policy allows time for detection and research. You may also wish to archive the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them. See the following AWS resource to manage CloudWatch Logs retention periods:\n\n1. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/SettingLogRetention.html\n\n**References**\n\n1. CCE-79202-8\n2. CIS CSC v6.0 #6.5, #12.9\n3. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html\n\n**Notes**\n\nChanged title from\n\n\"Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all applicable regions\" \n\nto\n\n\"Ensure VPC flow logging is enabled in all VPCs\"\n\nFor these reasons:\n\n1. Flow logs cannot be enabled for regions, only for VPCs\n2. The statement did not define an \"Applicable Region\" and did not clarify \"all VPCs in\napplicable regions\"\n3. All other benchmark recommendations appear to assume that you apply them \"any\nactively used configuration or resource\" or \"All resources\" - so specifying \"applicable\" to mean \"active\" or \"compliant with the benchmark\" seems unnecessary.\n\n",
