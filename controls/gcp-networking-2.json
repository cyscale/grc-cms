{"name":"Ensure legacy networks do not exist for a project","slug":"gcp-networking-2","body":"**Description: **\n\nIn order to prevent use of legacy networks, a project should not have a legacy network configured.\n\n**Rationale** \n\nLegacy networks have a single network IPv4 prefix range and a single gateway IP address for the whole network. The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions. You cannot create subnetworks in a legacy network or switch from legacy to auto or custom subnet networks. Legacy networks can thus have an impact for high network traffic projects and subject to the single point of contention or failure.","description":"","severity":3,"remediationDescription":"For each Google Cloud Platform project,\n\n1. Follow the documentation and create a non-legacy network suitable for your requirements.\n2. Follow the documentation and delete the networks in the `legacy` mode.\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, networks are not created in the `legacy` mode. \n\n**References**\n\n1. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#creating_a_legacy_network\n2. https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#legacy_non-subnet_network","rules":[{"cloudProviders":["gcp"],"comparator":"eq","expectedResult":"[]","subjects":["VPC"],"query":"gcp-networking-2-legacy-networks-do-not-exist-for-a-project","returnPath":""}]}
