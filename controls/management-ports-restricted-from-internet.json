  "remediationDescription": "#### Azure\r\n\r\nWhere SSH is not explicitly required and narrowly configured for resources attached to the Network Security Group, Internet-level access to your Azure resources should be restricted or eliminated.\r\n\r\n**From Azure Console**\r\n\r\n1. Go to `Virtual Machines`\r\n2. For each virtual machine you want to restrict SSH for, under `Settings`, go to `Networking`\r\n3. In the list of inbound port rules, delete any `Allow` rule with port 22 and with `Source` as `Any`, `Internet` or `0.0.0.0/0`. Review all `Allow` rules with port 22 that have static IPs and remove the ones that are not necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter direct SSH access from the Internet is disabled, you have other options you can use to access these virtual machines for remote management:\r\n\r\n- [Point-to-site VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-point-to-site-resource-manager-portal)\r\n- [Site-to-site VPN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal)\r\n- [ExpressRoute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/expressroute/)\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, SSH access from the internet is not `enabled`.\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n1. [Azure best practices for network security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-network-security-best-practices#disable-rdpssh-access-to-azure-virtual-machines)\r\n2. [Security Control V3: Network Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-network-security#ns-1-establish-network-segmentation-boundaries)\r\n\r\n#### AWS\r\n\r\nCheck your EC2 security groups for inbound rules that allow unrestricted access (i.e. `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`) to `TCP` port `22`. Restrict access to only those IP addresses that require it, in order to implement the principle of least privilege and reduce the possibility of a breach.\r\n\r\nPerform the following to implement the prescribed state:\r\n\r\n1. Login to the AWS Management Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home\r\n2. In the left pane, click `Security Groups`\r\n3. For each security group, perform the following:\r\n4. Select the security group\r\n5. Click the `Inbound Rules` tab\r\n6. Identify the rules to be removed\r\n7. Click the `x` in the `Remove` column\r\n8. Click `Save`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\n\r\nFor updating an existing environment, care should be taken to ensure that administrators currently relying on an existing ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 have access to ports 22 and/or 3389 through another security group.\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n1. [Security groups: inbound and outbound rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/vpc-security-groups.html)\r\n\r\n#### Alibaba\r\nSimilar with Azure, you have to check your Elastic Compute Services (ECS) security groups for inbound rules that allow unrestricted access (i.e. `0.0.0.0/0` or `::/0`) to `TCP` port `22`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\n\r\n1. [Security groups for different use cases](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/elastic-compute-service/latest/security-groups-for-different-use-cases)\r\n\r\n#### Google Cloud\r\n**From Console**\r\n\r\n1. Go to `VPC Network`.\r\n2. Go to the `Firewall Rules`.\r\n3. Click the `Firewall Rule` you want to modify.\r\n4. Click `Edit`.\r\n5. Modify `Source IP ranges` to specific `IP`.\r\n6. Click `Save`.\r\n\r\n**Via CLI gcloud **\r\n1. Update Firewall rule with new `SOURCE_RANGE` from below command: \r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngcloud compute firewall-rules update FirewallName --allow=[PROTOCOL[:PORT[-PORT]]] --source-range=[CIDR_RANGE]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\n\r\nAll SSH connections from outside of the network to the concerned VPC(s) will be blocked. There could be a business need where ssh access is required from outside of the network to access resources associated with the VPC. In that case, specific source IP(s) should be mentioned in firewall rules to white-list access to SSH port for the concerned VPC(s).\r\n\r\n**References**\r\n\r\n1. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/firewalls#blockedtraffic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Notes**\r\n\r\nCurrently Google Cloud VPC only supports IPV4 however, Google is already working on adding IPV6 support for VPC. In that case along with source IP range `0.0.0.0`, rule should be checked for IPv6 equivalent `::0` as well.",
