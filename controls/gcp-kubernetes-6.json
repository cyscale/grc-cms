{"name":"Ensure Kubernetes web UI / Dashboard is disabled","slug":"gcp-kubernetes-6","body":"Dashboard is a web-based Kubernetes user interface. You can use Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the cluster itself along with its attendant resources. You can use Dashboard to get an overview of applications running on your cluster, as well as for creating or modifying individual Kubernetes resources (such as Deployments, Jobs, DaemonSets, etc). For example, you can scale a Deployment, initiate a rolling update, restart a pod or deploy new applications using a deploy wizard.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nYou should disable the Kubernetes Web UI (Dashboard) when running on Kubernetes Engine. The Kubernetes Web UI (Dashboard) is backed by a highly privileged Kubernetes Service Account.","description":"","severity":3,"remediationDescription":"**From Console**\n\n1.
