  "body": "Ensure that users are notified of their primary and secondary emails on password resets.\n\n### Rationale\n\nUser notification on password reset is a proactive way of confirming password reset activity. It helps the user to recognize unauthorized password reset activities.\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers will receive emails alerting them to password changes to both their primary and secondary emails.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Notify users on password resets?` is set to \"Yes\".\n\n### Manual Audit\n\nThere is no customer-facing API available to check the Password Reset Policy. Please refer to the Remediation tab. **After you ensure the setting is correctly set, exempt the corresponding asset.**\n\nIf you need this checked automatically (it would make sense if you have multiple Entra ID tenants with multiple administrators who might change settings) and are willing to provide additional permissions, reach out to your Cyscale contact person.",
