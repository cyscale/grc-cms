  "body": "Ensure that unattached disks in a subscription are encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK).\n\n**Rationale**\n\nManaged disks are encrypted by default with Platform-managed keys. Using Customer-managed keys may provide an additional level of security or meet an organization's regulatory requirements. Encrypting managed disks ensures that its entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads. Even if the disk is not attached to any of the VMs, there is always a risk where a compromised user account with administrative access to VM service can mount/attach these data disks which may lead to sensitive information disclosure and tampering.\n\n**Impact**\n\nHaving a key vault set up to utilize this is needed. Encryption is available only on Standard tier VMs. This might increase costs.\n\nUtilizing and maintaining Customer-managed keys will require additional work to create, protect, and rotate keys.\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, managed disks are encrypted with a Platform-managed key.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
