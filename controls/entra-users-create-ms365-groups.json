Appropriate groups should be created and managed by the administrator, and group creation rights should not be delegated to any other user.\n\n### Impact\n\nEnabling this setting could create several requests that would need to be managed by an administrator.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Users can create Microsoft 365 groups in Azure portals, API or PowerShell` is set to `Yes`.",
