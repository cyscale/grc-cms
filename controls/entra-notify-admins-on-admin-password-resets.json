  "body": "Ensure that all Global Administrators are notified if any other administrator resets their password.\n\n### Rationale\n\nGlobal Administrator accounts are sensitive. Any password reset activity notification, when sent to all Global Administrators, ensures that all Global administrators can passively confirm if such a reset is a common pattern within their group. For example, if all Global Administrators change their password every 30 days, any password reset activity before that may require administrator(s) to evaluate any unusual activity and confirm its origin.\n\n### Impact\n\nAll Global Administrators will receive a notification from Azure every time a password is reset. This is useful for auditing procedures to confirm that there are no out-of-the-ordinary password resets for Global Administrators. There is additional overhead, however, in the time required for Global Administrators to audit the notifications. This setting is only useful if all Global Administrators pay attention to the notifications and audit each one.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Notify all admins when other admins reset their password?` is set to \"No\".",
