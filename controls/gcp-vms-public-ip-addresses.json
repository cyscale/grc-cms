  "body": "Compute instances should not be configured to have external IP addresses.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nTo reduce your attack surface, Compute instances should not have public IP addresses. Instead, instances should be configured behind load balancers, to minimize the instance's exposure to the internet.\n\n**Impact**\n\nRemoving the external IP address from your Compute instance may cause some applications to stop working.",
  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to the `VM instances` page by visiting: https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances\n2. Click on each VM instance name to go to its details page\n3. Click `STOP` and then click `EDIT`\n4. For each Network interface, ensure that External IP is set to None.\n5. Click `Save` and then click `START`\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\n1. Describe the instance properties:\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances describe <instanceName> --zone=<zone>\n```\n\n2. Identify the access config name that contains the external IP address. This access config appears in the following format:\n\n```json\nnetworkInterfaces:\n- accessConfigs:\n- kind: compute#accessConfig\n name: External NAT\n natIP: 130.211.181.55\n type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT\n```\n\n3. Delete the access config.\n\n```bash\ngcloud compute instances delete-access-config <instanceName> --zone=<zone> --access-config-name <accessConfigName>\n```\n\nIn the above example, the accessConfigName is External NAT. The name of your access config might be different.\n\n**Prevention**\n\nYou can configure the Define allowed external IPs for VM instances Organization Policy to prevent VMs from being configured with public IP addresses. Learn more at: https://console.cloud.google.com/orgpolicies/compute-vmExternalIpAccess\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, Compute instances have a public IP address.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
