{"name":"Ensure Basic Authentication is disabled on Kubernetes Engine Clusters","slug":"gcp-kubernetes-10","body":"Basic authentication allows a user to authenticate to the cluster with a username and password and it is stored in plain text without any encryption. Disabling Basic authentication will prevent attacks like brute force. Its recommended to use either client certificate or IAM for authentication.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nWhen disabled, you will still be able to authenticate to the cluster with client certificate or IAM. A client certificate is a base64-encoded public certificate used by clients to authenticate to the cluster endpoint. Disable client certificate generation to create a cluster without a client certificate.","description":"","severity":3,"remediationDescription":"**Using Console**\n\n1.
