The most common types of these attacks use exposed DNS, NTP, SSDP, SNMP, CLDAP and other UDP-based services as amplification source for disrupting services of other machines on the Azure Virtual Network or even attack networked devices outside of Azure.","description":"","severity":2,"remediationDescription":"Disable direct UDP access to your Azure Virtual Machines from the Internet.
