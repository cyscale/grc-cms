  "body": "A service account is a special Google account that belongs to your application or a VM, instead of to an individual end user. Your application uses the service account to call the Google API of a service, so that the users aren't directly involved. It's recommended not to use admin access for Service Account.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nService accounts represent service-level security of the Resources (application or a VM) which can be determined by the roles assigned to it. Enrolling Service Account with Admin rights gives full access to assigned application or a VM. A Service Account Access holder can perform critical actions like delete, update change settings etc. without the intervention of user. For this reason, it is  recommended not to have Admin rights.\n\n**Impact**\n\nRemoving `*Admin` or `*admin` or `Editor` or `Owner` role assignments from service accounts may break functionality that uses impacted service accounts. Required role(s) should be assigned to impacted service accounts in order to restore broken functionalities.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n1. Go to `IAM & admin`, and then `IAM` using https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam\n2. Under `VIEW BY PRINCIPALS`, identify `User-Managed user created` service accounts with roles containing `*Admin` or role matching `Editor` or role matching `Owner`\n3. Click the `Delete` bin icon to remove role from member (service account in this case)\n\n**From Google Cloud CLI**\n\nRetrieve details about the IAM policies:\n\n```bash\ngcloud projects get-iam-policy <projectID> --format json > iam.json\n```\n\nUsing a text editor, remove the role which contains `roles/*Admin` or `roles/*admin` or matches `roles/editor` or matches `roles/owner`. Add a role to the bindings array that defines the group members and the role for those members.\n\nUpdate the project's IAM policy:\n\n```bash\ngcloud projects set-iam-policy <projectID> iam.json\n```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, there are no roles assigned to `User Managed User created` service accounts.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
