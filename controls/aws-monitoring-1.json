{"name":"Ensure a log metric filter and alarm exist for unauthorized API calls","slug":"aws-monitoring-1","body":"Real-time monitoring of API calls can be achieved by directing CloudTrail Logs to CloudWatch Logs and establishing corresponding metric filters and alarms. It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for unauthorized API calls.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nMonitoring unauthorized API calls will help reveal application errors and may reduce time to detect malicious activity.","description":"","severity":1,"remediationDescription":"Perform the following to setup the metric filter, alarm, SNS topic, and subscription:\n\n1. Create a metric filter based on filter pattern provided which checks for unauthorized API calls and the \u003ccloudtrail_log_group_name\u003e taken from audit step 1.\n\n```bash\naws logs put-metric-filter --log-group-name \u003ccloudtrail_log_group_name\u003e --filter-name `\u003cunauthorized_api_calls_metric\u003e` --metric-transformations metricName=`\u003cunauthorized_api_calls_metric\u003e`,metricNamespace='CISBenchmark',metricValue=1 --filter-pattern '{ ($.errorCode = \"*UnauthorizedOperation\") || ($.errorCode = \"AccessDenied*\") }'\n```\n\n**Note** You can choose your own metricName and metricNamespace strings. Using the same metricNamespace for all Foundations Benchmark metrics will group them together.\n\n2. Create an SNS topic that the alarm will notify\n\n```bash\naws sns create-topic --name \u003csns_topic_name\u003e\n```\n\n**Note** you can execute this command once and then re-use the same topic for all monitoring alarms.\n\n3. Create an SNS subscription to the topic created in step 2\n\n```bash\naws sns subscribe --topic-arn \u003csns_topic_arn\u003e --protocol \u003cprotocol_for_sns\u003e --notification-endpoint \u003csns_subscription_endpoints\u003e\n```\n\n**Note** you can execute this command once and then re-use the SNS subscription for all monitoring alarms.\n\n4. Create an alarm that is associated with the CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter created in step 1 and an SNS topic created in step 2\n\n```bash\naws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --alarm-name `\u003cunauthorized_api_calls_alarm\u003e` --metric-name `\u003cunauthorized_api_calls_metric\u003e` --statistic Sum --period 300 --threshold 1 --comparison-operator GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold --evaluation-periods 1 -- namespace 'CISBenchmark' --alarm-actions \u003csns_topic_arn\u003e\n```\n\n**Impact**\n\nThis alert may be triggered by normal read-only console activities that attempt to opportunistically gather optional information, but gracefully fail if they don't have permissions.\n\nIf an excessive number of alerts are being generated then an organization may wish to consider adding read access to the limited IAM user permissions simply to quiet the alerts.\n\nIn some cases doing this may allow the users to actually view some areas of the system - any additional access given should be reviewed for alignment with the original limited IAM user intent.\n\n**References**\n\n1. https://aws.amazon.com/sns/\n2.
