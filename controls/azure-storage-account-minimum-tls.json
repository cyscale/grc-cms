  "body": "In some cases, Azure Storage sets the minimum TLS version to be 1.0 by default. TLS 1.0 is a legacy version with known vulnerabilities. However, this minimum TLS version can be configured to be later protocols, such as TLS 1.2.\n\n### Rationale\n\nTLS 1.0 has known vulnerabilities and has been replaced by later versions of the TLS protocol. Continued use of this legacy protocol affects the security of data in transit.\n\n### Impact\n\nWhen set to TLS 1.2, all requests must use this version of the protocol. Applications using legacy versions of the protocol will fail.\n\n### Default Value\n\nIf a storage account is created through the portal, its MinimumTlsVersion property will be set to TLS 1.2.\n\nIf a storage account is created through PowerShell or CLI, the MinimumTlsVersion property for that storage account will not be set and will default to TLS 1.0.",
