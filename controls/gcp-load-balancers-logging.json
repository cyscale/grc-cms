  "body": "Logging enabled on a HTTPS Load Balancer will show all network traffic and its destination.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nLogging will allow you to view HTTPS network traffic to your web applications.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nOn high use systems with a high percentage sample rate, the logging file may grow to high capacity in a short amount of time. Ensure that the sample rate is set appropriately so that storage costs are not exorbitant.\r\n",

  "remediationDescription": "## Remediation\r\n\r\n### From Console\r\n\r\n1. From Google Cloud home open the Navigation Menu in the top left.\r\n2. Under the `Networking` heading select `Network services`.\r\n3. Select the HTTPS load-balancer you wish to audit.\r\n4. Select `Edit` then `Backend Configuration`.\r\n5. Select `Edit` on the corresponding backend service.\r\n6. Click `Enable Logging`.\r\n7. Set `Sample Rate` to a desired value. This is a percentage as a decimal point. 1.0 is 100%.\r\n\r\n### From Command Line\r\n\r\n1. Run the following command\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngcloud compute backend-services update <serviceName> --region=REGION --enable-logging --logging-sample-rate=<percentageAsADecimal>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Default Value\r\n\r\nBy default logging for https load balancing is disabled. When logging is enabled it sets the default sample rate as 1.0 or 100%. Ensure this value fits the need of your organization to avoid high storage costs.\r\n",
