  "body": "The Key Vault contains object keys, secrets, and certificates. Accidental unavailability of a Key Vault can cause immediate data loss or loss of security functions (authentication, validation, verification, non-repudiation, etc.) supported by the Key Vault objects.\n\nIt is recommended that the Key Vault be made recoverable by enabling the \"Do Not Purge\" and \"Soft Delete\" functions. This prevents the loss of encrypted data, including storage accounts, SQL databases, and/or dependent services provided by Key Vault objects (Keys, Secrets, Certificates), etc. This may happen in the case of accidental deletion by a user or disruptive activity by a malicious user.\n\n**NOTE:** In February 2025, Microsoft will enable soft-delete protection on all key vaults, and users can no longer opt out of or turn off soft-delete. \n\n**WARNING:** A current limitation is that role assignments disappear when the Key Vault is deleted. After recovery, all role assignments will need to be recreated.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThere could be scenarios where users accidentally run delete/purge commands on Key Vault, or an attacker/malicious user deliberately does so to cause disruption. Deleting or purging a Key Vault leads to immediate data loss, as keys encrypting data and secrets/certificates allowing access/services will become non-accessible. \n\nThere is a Key Vault property that plays a role in permanent unavailability of a Key Vault:\n\n`enablePurgeProtection`: Setting this parameter to \"true\" for a Key Vault ensures that even if the Key Vault is deleted, the Key Vault itself or its objects remain recoverable for the next 90 days. Key Vault/objects can be recovered or purged (permanently deleted) during those 90 days. If no action is taken, the key vault and its objects will subsequently be purged.\n\nEnabling the enablePurgeProtection parameter on Key Vaults ensures that Key Vaults and their objects cannot be deleted/purged permanently.\n\n### Impact\n\nOnce purge protection and soft delete are enabled for a Key Vault, the action is irreversible.\n\n### Default Value\n\nWhen a new Key Vault is created,\n- `enableSoftDelete` is enabled by default, and \n- `enablePurgeProtection` is disabled by default.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
