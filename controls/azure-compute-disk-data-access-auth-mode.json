  "body": "Data Access Authentication Mode provides a method of uploading or exporting Virtual Machine Disks.\n\n### Rationale\n\nEnabling `data access authentication mode` adds a layer of protection using an Entra ID role to further restrict users from creating and using Secure Access Signature (SAS) tokens for exporting a detached managed disk or virtual machine state. Users will need the `Data operator for managed disk` role within Entra ID to download a VHD or VM Guest state using a secure URL.\n\n### Impact\n\nTo apply this setting, the virtual machine to which the disk or disks are attached must be powered down and have their disk detached. Users without the `Data operator for managed disk` role within Entra ID cannot export VHD or VM Guest state using the secure download URL.",
