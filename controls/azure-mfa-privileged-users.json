  "body": "If your organization pays for Microsoft Entra ID licensing (included in Microsoft 365 E3, E5, or F5, and EM&S E3 or E5 licenses) and **can** use Conditional Access, ignore the recommendations in this section and proceed to the Conditional Access section.\n\nEnable multi-factor authentication for all roles, groups, and users with write access or permissions to Azure resources. These include custom-created objects or built-in roles such as:\n\n- Service Co-Administrators\n- Subscription Owners\n- Contributors\n\n### Rationale\n\nMulti-factor authentication requires an individual to present at least two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.\n\n### Impact\n\nUsers would require two forms of authentication before access is granted. Enabling multi-factor authentication will require additional administrative time to manage dual forms of authentication.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, multi-factor authentication is disabled for all users.\n\n### References\n\n- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factorauthentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/multi-factor-authentication/multi-factorauthentication)\n- [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41156206/azure-active-directory-premiummfa-attributes-via-graph-api](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41156206/azure-active-directory-premiummfa-attributes-via-graph-api)\n- [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-identitymanagement#im-4-authenticate-server-and-services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/mcsb-identitymanagement#im-4-authenticate-server-and-services)",
