  "body": "Restrict access to the Microsoft Entra ID administration portal to administrators only.\n\n**NOTE:** This only affects access to the Entra ID administrator's web portal. This setting does not prohibit privileged users from using other methods, such as Rest API or Powershell, to obtain sensitive information from Microsoft Entra ID.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe Microsoft Entra ID administrative center has sensitive data and permission settings. To avoid exposure, all non-administrators should be prohibited from accessing any Microsoft Entra ID data in the administration center.\n\n### Impact\n\nAll administrative tasks will need to be done by Administrators, causing additional overhead in managing users and resources.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, `Restrict access to Microsoft Entra admin center` is set to `No`.\n\n### Manual Audit\n\nThere is no customer-facing API available to check the Password Reset Policy. Please refer to the Remediation tab. **After you ensure the setting is correctly set, exempt the corresponding asset.**\n\nIf you need this checked automatically (it would make sense if you have multiple Entra ID tenants with multiple administrators who might change settings) and are willing to provide additional permissions, reach out to your Cyscale contact person.",
