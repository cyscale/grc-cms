Select `Create metric`\n3. For `Metric Type`, select `Counter`\n4. Under `Details`, add a name and set the `Units` to `1`\n5. Under `Filter selection`, add the following query:\n\n```bash\nprotoPayload.methodName=\"cloudsql.instances.update\"\n```\n\n6. Click `Create Metric`. This will take to `Logging/Logs` at https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics?\n\n### Create the alert policy\n\n1. Go back to `Log-based Metrics` and identify the newly created metric under `User-defined metrics`\n2. Click the 3-dot icon in rightmost column of that metric to open menu options and select `Create alert from Metric`\n3. Fill in the required details. Choose the alerting threshold and configuration that makes sense for the organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value ensures that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project:\n\n```bash\nSet `Aggregator` to `Count`\nSet `Configuration`:\n- Condition: above\n- Threshold: 0\n- For: most recent value\n```\n4. Under `Configure notifications`, configure the desired notification channels\n5. Name the policy and select `CREATE POLICY`\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\nCreate prescribed Log Metric\n\n- Use command: gcloud beta logging metrics create\n- Reference for Command Usage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/logging/metrics/create \n\nCreate prescribed Alert Policy\n- Use command: gcloud alpha monitoring policies create\n- Reference for command Usage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/monitoring/policies/create\n\n**References**\n\n1.

Click down arrow symbol on `Filter Bar` at rightmost corner and select `Convert to Advanced Filter`\n3. This will convert `Filter Bar` to `Advanced Filter Bar`\n4. Clear any text from `Advanced Filter` and add text\n```\nprotoPayload.methodName=\"cloudsql.instances.update\"\n```\n\n5. Click on `Submit Filter` and should display logs based on filter text set in step above\n6. Click `Create Metric` it will open `Metric Export` Menu on right\n7. Configure `Name, Description` to desired values\n8. Set `Units` to 1 (default) and `Type` to `Counter`\n9. Click `Create Metric`. This will take to `Logging/Logs` at https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics?\n\n**From stackdriver Console, Create prescribed Alert Policy**\n\n1. Go to `Logging/Metrics` by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics?\n2. In section `User-defined Metrics` for target metric, click 3 dot icon in rightmost column to open menu options\n3. Select `Create alert from Metric`.\n4. It will take to `Stackdriver Console\\Alerting\\Create` and directly open `Add Metric Threshold Condition` window\n```\nSet `Target`: `Resource Type` to `Log Metric` Set `Configuration`:\n- IF METRIC : user/<Log Metric Name>\n- Condition : above\n- Threshold: .001\n- For: 1 minute\nSet `Resource` to `ANY`\n```\nClick `Save` Condition\n\n5. It will take back to `Stackdriver Console\\Alerting\\Create`\n6. In Section `2 Notifications` click + `Add Notification`. Add desired channel(s) as required.\n7. In section `3 Documentation` optionally `+ Add Documentation`\n8. In Section `4 Name this policy` leave system provided policy name (Threshold - user/) or configure custom name\n9. Click `Save Policy`. It will open `Alerting/Policies Overview` page which lists all the alert policies including this one.\nFor alert policy Observe Condition which is currently set to\n```\nAny logging.googleapis.com/user/<Log_Metric_Name> is above a threshold of 0.001 for greater than 1 minute\n```\n\nIt is been observed that without following next step, Alert policy will not generate any alerts or open any incidents.\n\n10. For newly created policy, click `EDIT` to Open `Edit alerting Policy` pane\n11. At section 1 Conditions\\Basic Conditions\\suggested condition click `Edit`\n12. In `Target` Section, for `Aggregation` drop down select `count`\n13. Click `save condition` and then click `Save Policy`. It will open `Alerting/Policies Overview`\n\nCondition for same alert policy will be updated to:\n```\nViolates when: Any logging.googleapis.com/user/<Log_Metric_Name> stream is\nabove a threshold of 0.001 for greater than 1 minute\n```\nNow, newly created Alert policy will be able to generate alerts or open incidents.\n\n**Using CLI**\n\nCreate prescribed Log Metric\n\n- Use command: gcloud beta logging metrics create\n- Reference for Command Usage:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/logging/metrics/create \n\nCreate prescribed Alert Policy\n- Use command: gcloud alpha monitoring policies create\n- Reference for command Usage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/monitoring/policies/create\n\n**Impact**\n\nBased on Service Tiers, Stackdriver account may be charged.\n\n**References**\n\n1. https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/logs-based-metrics/\n2. https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics/\n3. https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts/\n4. https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/tools/gcloud-logging\n5. https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/overview\n6. https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/\n7. https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/\n8. https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/\n\n**Notes** . \nBefore considering this recommendation Ensure target GCP project is configured with stackdriver account.",
