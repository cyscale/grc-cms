These charges could be significant depending on the size of the organization.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Google Cloud Console**\n\n### Create the Log Metric\n\n1. Go to `Logging`, `Log-based Metrics` by visiting https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics\n2. Select `Create metric`\n3. For `Metric Type`, select `Counter`\n4. Under `Details`, add a name and set the `Units` to `1`\n5. Under `Filter selection`, add the following query:\n\n```bash\nprotoPayload.methodName=\"cloudsql.instances.update\"\n```\n\n6. Click `Create Metric`. This will take to `Logging/Logs` at https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/metrics?\n\n### Create the alert policy\n\n1. Go back to `Log-based Metrics` and identify the newly created metric under `User-defined metrics`\n2. Click the 3-dot icon in rightmost column of that metric to open menu options and select `Create alert from Metric`\n3. Fill in the required details. Choose the alerting threshold and configuration that makes sense for the organization. For example, a threshold of zero(0) for the most recent value ensures that a notification is triggered for every owner change in the project:\n\n```bash\nSet `Aggregator` to `Count`\nSet `Configuration`:\n- Condition: above\n- Threshold: 0\n- For: most recent value\n```\n4. Under `Configure notifications`, configure the desired notification channels\n5. Name the policy and select `CREATE POLICY`\n\n**Using Google Cloud CLI**\n\nCreate prescribed Log Metric\n\n- Use command: gcloud beta logging metrics create\n- Reference for Command Usage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/logging/metrics/create \n\nCreate prescribed Alert Policy\n- Use command: gcloud alpha monitoring policies create\n- Reference for command Usage: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/alpha/monitoring/policies/create\n\n**References**\n\n1.
