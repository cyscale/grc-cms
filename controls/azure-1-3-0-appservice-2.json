{"name":"Ensure web app redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS in Azure App Service","slug":"azure-1-3-0-appservice-2","body":"Azure Web Apps allows sites to run under both HTTP andHTTPS by default. Web apps can be accessed by anyone using non-secure HTTP links by default. Non-secure HTTP requests can be restricted and all HTTP requests redirected to the secure HTTPS port. It is recommended to enforce HTTPS-only traffic.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nEnabling HTTPS-only traffic will redirect all non-secure HTTP request to HTTPS ports. HTTPS uses the SSL/TLS protocol to provide a secure connection, which is both encrypted and authenticated. So it is important to support HTTPS for the security benefits.\n\n**Impact**\n\nWhen it is enabled, every incoming HTTP requests are redirected to the HTTPS port. It means an extra level of security will be added to the HTTP requests made to the app.","description":"","severity":3,"remediationDescription":"**From Azure Console**\n\n1. Login to Azure Portal using https://portal.azure.com\n2. Go to `App Services`\n3. Click on each App\n4. Under `Settings` section, Click on `SSL settings`\n5. Set `HTTPS Only` to `On` under `Protocol Settings` section\n\n**Using Azure Command Line Interface**\n\nTo set HTTPS-only traffic value for an existing app, run the following command:\n\n\u003e`az webapp update --resource-group \u003cRESOURCE_GROUP_NAME\u003e --name \u003cAPP_NAME\u003e --set httpsOnly=true`\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, HTTPS-only feature will be disabled when a new app is created using the command-line tool or Azure Portal console.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
