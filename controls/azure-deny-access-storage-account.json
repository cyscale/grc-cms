  "body": "Restricting default network access helps to provide a new layer of security since storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. The default action must be changed to limit access to selected networks.\n\n### Rationale\n\nStorage accounts should be configured to deny access to traffic from all networks (including internet traffic). Access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure Virtual networks, allowing a secure network boundary for specific applications to be built. Access can also be granted to public internet IP address ranges to enable connections from specific internet or on-premises clients. Only applications from allowed networks can access a storage account when network rules are configured. When calling from an allowed network, applications continue to require proper authorization (a valid access key or SAS token) to access the storage account.\n\n### Default Value\n\nBy default, Storage Accounts will accept connections from clients on any network.\n\n### References\n\n1.
