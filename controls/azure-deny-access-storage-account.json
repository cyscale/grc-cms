  "body": "Restricting default network access helps to provide a new layer of security, since storage accounts accept connections from clients on any network. To limit access to selected networks, the default action must be changed.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nStorage accounts should be configured to deny access to traffic from all networks (including internet traffic). Access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure Virtual networks, allowing a secure network boundary for specific applications to be built. Access can also be granted to public internet IP address ranges, to enable connections from specific internet or on-premises clients. When network rules are configured, only applications from allowed networks can access a storage account. When calling from an allowed network, applications continue to require proper authorization (a valid access key or SAS token) to access the storage account.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Azure Console**\n\n1. Go to `Storage Accounts`\n2. For each storage account, Click on the `Networking` blade\n3. Click the `Firewalls and virtual networks` heading\n4. Ensure that, under `Public network access`, `Enabled from all networks` is not selected\n5. Click `Save` to apply your changes\n\n**Using Azure Command Line Interface**\n\nUse the below command to update `default-action` to `Deny`.\n\n```bash\naz storage account update --name <StorageAccountName> --resource-group <resourceGroupName> --default-action Deny\n```\n\n**Default value**\n\nBy default, Storage Accounts will accept connections from clients on any network.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
