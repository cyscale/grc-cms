  "body": "This recommendation ensures that users accessing the Windows Azure Service Management API (i.e., Azure Powershell, Azure CLI, Azure Resource Manager API, etc.) must use multifactor authentication (MFA) credentials when accessing resources through the Windows Azure Service Management API.\n\n### Rationale\n\nAdministrative access to the Windows Azure Service Management API should be secured with a higher level of scrutiny to authenticating mechanisms. Enabling multifactor authentication is recommended to reduce the potential for abuse of Administrative actions and to prevent intruders or compromised admin credentials from changing administrative settings.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: While this recommendation allows exceptions to specific Users or Groups, they should be very carefully tracked and reviewed for necessity on a regular interval through an Access Review process. This rule must be built to include \"All Users\" to ensure that all users not specifically excepted will be required to use MFA to access the Azure Service Management API.\n\n### Impact\n\nConditional Access policies require Microsoft Entra ID **P1** or **P2** licenses. Similarly, they may require additional maintenance overhead if users lose access to their MFA. Any users or groups that are granted an exception to this policy should be carefully tracked and be granted only minimal necessary privileges, and conditional access exceptions should be regularly reviewed or investigated.\n\n### Default Value\n\nMFA is not enabled by default for administrative actions.",
