  "body": "Disable anonymous access to blob containers and disallow blob public access on storage account.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAnonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature. It is recommended not to provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers. If no anonymous access is needed on the storage account, it’s recommended to set allowBlobPublicAccess false.\n\n**Impact**\n\nAccess using shared access signatures will have to be managed.",

  "remediationDescription": "**From Azure Console**\n\nFirst, follow the Microsoft documentation and create shared access signature tokens for your blob containers. Then, follow these steps:\n\nTo change the access level for containers\n\n1. Go to `Storage Accounts`\n2. For each storage account, go to `Containers` under `Data storage`\n3. For each container, click `Change access level`\n4. Select for `Public access level` the `Private (no anonymous access)` option\n\nTo change the access level for blobs\n\n1. Go to `Storage Accounts`\n2. For each storage account, under `Settings`, go to `Configuration`\n3. Set `Disabled` for `Allow Blob public access` if no anonymous access is needed on the storage account\n\n**Using Azure Command Line Interface**\n\nSet the permission for public access to `private`(off) for the container\n\n```bash\naz storage container set-permission --name <containerName> --public-access off --account-name <accountName> --account-key <accountKey>\n```\nD﻿isallow public blob access for the storage account.\n\n```bash\naz storage account update --name <storage_account> --resource-group <resource_group> --allow-blob-public-access false\n```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, `Public access level` is set to `Private (no anonymous access)` for blob containers. By default, AllowBlobPublicAccess is set to Null (allow in effect) for storage account.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
