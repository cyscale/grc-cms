{"name":"Ensure that 'Public access level' is set to Private for blob containers","slug":"azure-1-3-0-storage-5","body":"Disable anonymous access to blob containers and disallow blob public access on storage account.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nAnonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature. It is recommended not to provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers. If no anonymous access is needed on the storage account, itâ€™s recommended to set allowBlobPublicAccess false.\n\n**Impact**\n\nAccess using shared access signatures will have to be managed.","description":"","severity":2,"remediationDescription":"**From Azure Console**\n\nFirst, follow Microsoft documentation and created shared access signature tokens for your blob containers. Then,\n\n1. Go to `Storage Accounts`\n2. For each storage account, go to `Containers` under `BLOB SERVICE`\n3. For each container, click `Access policy`\n4. Set `Public access level` to `Private (no anonymous access)`\n5. For each storage account, go to `Allow Blob public access` in Configuration\n6. Set `Disabled` if no anonymous access is needed on the storage account\n\nUsing Azure Command Line Interface 2.0\n\n1. Identify the container name from the audit command\n2. Set the permission for public access to `private`(off) for the above container name, using the below command\n\n```bash\naz storage container set-permission --name \u003ccontainerName\u003e --public-access off --account-name \u003caccountName\u003e --account-key \u003caccountKey\u003e\n```\n\n3. Set Disabled if no anonymous access is wanted on the storage account\n\n```bash\naz storage account update --name \u003cstorage_account\u003e --resource-group \u003cresource_group\u003e --allow-blob-public-access false\n```\n\n**Default Value**\n\nBy default, `Public access level` is set to `Private (no anonymous access)` for blob containers. By default, AllowBlobPublicAccess is set to Null (allow in effect) for storage account.\n\n**References**\n\n1.
