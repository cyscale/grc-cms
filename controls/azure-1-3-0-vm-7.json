  "body": "**NOTE: This is a legacy recommendation. Managed Disks are encrypted by default and recommended for all new VM implementations.**\n\nVHD (Virtual Hard Disks) are stored in BLOB storage. They are the old-style disks that were attached to Virtual Machines, and the BLOB VHD was then leased to the VM. By default, storage accounts are not encrypted, and Azure Defender(Security Centre) would then recommend that the OS disks be encrypted. Storage accounts can be encrypted as a whole using PMK or CMK, and this should be turned on for storage accounts containing VHDs.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nWith the changes that have been made that recommend using managed disks that are encrypted by default, we also need to have a recommendation that \"legacy\" disks that may, for several reasons, need to be left as VHDs should also be encrypted to protect the data content.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe size of the impact will depend on how the encryption is implemented; if provider-managed keys(PMK) are utilized, the impact is relatively low, but processes need to be put in place to rotate the keys regularly. If customer-managed keys(CMK) are utilized, a key management process needs to be implemented to store and manage key rotation, and thus, the impact is medium to high, depending on user maturity with key management.",
