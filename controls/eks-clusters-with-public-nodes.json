Private Nodes are nodes with no public IP addresses.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nDisabling public IP addresses on cluster nodes restricts access to only internal \r\nnetworks, forcing attackers to obtain local network access before attempting to \r\ncompromise the underlying Kubernetes hosts.\n\n**Impact**\n\nTo enable Private Nodes, the cluster has to also be configured with a private master IP \r\nrange and IP Aliasing enabled.\n\n\r\nPrivate Nodes do not have outbound access to the public internet. If you want to provide \r\noutbound Internet access for your private nodes, you can use Cloud NAT or you can \r\nmanage your own NAT gateway",
